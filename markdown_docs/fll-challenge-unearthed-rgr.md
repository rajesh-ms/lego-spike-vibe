UNEARTHEDTM3Welcome!
Welcome to the FIRST® AGE™ season presented by
Qualcomm. This season, your team will work together
as you prepare to compete at an event.
This Robot Game Rulebook contains the missions,
rules, and links to the resources you need to be
successful in playing the robot game. In addition
to the Robot Game Rulebook , teams should use
the Engineering Notebook to guide your progress
throughout the season and to document your team
journey, which you will share with judges during the
judging session. Season Resource Page
At an event, your team’s performance will be
evaluated based on four equally weighted
components, each accounting for 25% of your total
score. Your team will present your Robot Design and
Innovation Project work during the judging session,
and your Robot Performance will be evaluated at
the robot game. Core Values are evaluated in all
parts of your work, and you will receive scores from
the judges and referees for how you apply them.
You should review the scoresheets, judging rubrics,
and awards list to see how your team will be scored
across all parts of the event.FIRST ® LEGO® League Challenge Events
PIE CHART GRAPHIC
UNEARTHED™
Get ready to dig deep into history as this year’s
UNEARTHED™ robot game takes you on an exciting
archaeological adventure. Your team will explore a
dig site, carefully excavating artifacts hidden beneath
layers of rock and soil and uncovering clues that reveal
stories of past civilizations. As you journey farther into
the dig site, you’ll encounter more challenging terrain, fragile ruins, and delicate artifacts that require precision
to retrieve without damage.
Along the way, you’ll decode mysteries and help share
stories of the artifacts you find. Prepare to unearth
hidden treasures and piece together the past as you
embark on this thrilling journey of discovery!
Robot Game Rulebook I Introduction4The above list is meant to help your team understand your goals for competing in the robot game. A glossary of the
bold terms and a complete list of rules for the robot game are found on pages 13-18 of this guide.The Robot Game
The robot game is the exciting culmination of your team’s hard work throughout the season. You’ll put your
creativity, strategy, and teamwork to the test during each 2.5-minute match. To be successful, your team will
need to:
• Develop a Mission Strategy: It’s up to you
to determine which missions your team will
attempt, the order you complete them, and what
attachments and programming you need. You may
choose to focus on a few high-scoring missions or
aim for a combination of missions to maximize your
score.
• Design and Program a Robot: Work together to
design and build a LEGO® robot. The robot must
operate autonomously , meaning that it will follow
pre-programmed instructions written by your team
to complete missions on the robot game field.
• Launch from Home: Your robot must always start
from one of the launch areas inside home. The
robot should be programmed and equipped with
the necessary attachments for the missions your
team is attempting.
• Complete Missions: During a match, your team
earns points as your robot completes missions, or
tasks. Missions are represented by LEGO models,
referred to as mission models, that are positioned
around the field. Missions can challenge the robot
to manipulate objects, activate mechanisms, or
move items to designated areas. • Understand Scoring: Mission requirements
must be visible at the end of the match to score,
unless otherwise stated. In competitions, you will
participate in three matches to show what your
robot can do. Each round offers an opportunity
to improve your score and strategies. Only your
team’s best score of the three official matches
counts toward awards and advancement at the
event.
• Demonstrate Gracious Professionalism®:
The robot game is about not only the robot’s
performance but also how your team expresses
the Core Values through Gracious Professionalism
and Coopertition®. Keep the Core Values in mind
as you work on robot game missions and let your
sportsmanship and fair play shine.
UNEARTHEDTM5Inside the Challenge Set
Inside the UNEARTHEDTM Challenge Set, you will find a
mat, 3M™ Dual Lock™ Reclosable Fasteners, and the
mission models. The mission models will come in numbered
bags and must be built by your team using the Mission
Model Building Instructions.
Dual LockChallenge

6GETTING STARTED | HELPFUL RESOURCES
• Decide whether to roll out your mat on a table
or the floor. Matches will be played on tables at
official events. You can use the optional Table
Building Instructions to build your own table to
practice on.
• The table at the bottom of page 7 shows
which numbered bags from the Challenge Set
correspond with each mission model in the
Mission Model Building Instructions.
• Set up your field by following the Field Setup
Video. Additional field setup instructions can be
found on page 7 of this guide.
• Watch the Robot Game Missions Video and
read the complete missions and rules in this
guide. The Missions section (pages 8-12)
describes each mission model and the points that
can be scored. The Rules section (pages 13-18)
describes how to play the game, what equipment
is allowed, how a match is run, what a team can
and cannot do during a match, and how points
are calculated. • Check the Challenge Updates often! This list is
updated throughout the season to include official
rule updates, clarifications, and amendments. It
is especially important to read these leading up to
your event.
• Practice calculating your match scores using an
Official Scoring Calculator. There are online
and offline calculator tools available.
• For help with building and coding your robot,
check out the LEGO® Education SPIKE™
App. The app offers a guided mission for the
UNEARTHEDTM robot game that your team can
use as a starting point.

UNEARTHEDTM7GETTING STARTED | FIELD SETUP
Field Setup
VideoOnce you have built the mission models, you are ready to
set up your field. The following steps are general guidance
for setting up your field for the first time. You will also need to
watch the Field Setup Video on the FIRST® LEGO® League
YouTube channel.
Tournament setups at events may differ from
your practice setup, including variations in table
construction, surface smoothness, or shared mission
interactions. Be prepared to adapt and approach
these scenarios with Gracious Professionalism®
if they occur.
IMPORTANT!Step 1: Roll Out the Mat
Unroll the mat and lay it flat on the floor or table. If you are using a table, align the mat to the bottom wall and
center it between the left and right walls.
Optional: Tape down your mat along the edges to secure it in place. Thin, matte, black gaffer’s tape is
recommended for easy removal without damage to the mat.
Step 2: Place the Dual Lock
Locate the spots on the mat where Dual Lock is needed. Carefully stick one piece of Dual Lock on each spot
with the sticky side down, aligning it carefully to the wireframe. Then, place another piece of Dual Lock on top of
each spot with the sticky side up. These pieces will “click” together when the models are placed.
Step 3: Place the Mission Models
Watch the Field Setup Video to see how to place each mission model onto the mat. Align each model exactly
to the mat wireframe.
Gently press down on the model until you hear a “click” to engage the Dual Lock.
Step 4: Set Up for a Match
Before any match, double-check that each mission model and any loose pieces are in their correct starting
positions.
At an event, volunteers do their best to ensure the field is set up correctly before the team arrives. Teams
should check the field and let the referee know if any changes need to be made before the match begins.

15BEFORE THE MATCH | MATCH SETUP
At events, matches will be played on official tables.
Before the match begins, teams will need to pass
the pre-match inspection and set all their equipment
in place.
During the pre-match inspection, the referee
will check that all team equipment fits within
the two launch areas and under a height limit
of 12 in. (305 mm). If the team can fit all their
equipment into just one launch area under a
height limit, they will earn 20 points.
Teams will not be given additional storage
space. Everything must stay on the table or in
the hands of the technicians at the table. The
areas to the left and right of the mat can be
used to store equipment; they each measure
approximately 6.75 in. (171 mm) by 45 in.
(1,143 mm) (actual measurements may vary).
Equipment stored on the table may extend past
the left and right walls only, as needed.
After the team has passed inspection, they will
be given a couple of minutes to set up. They
start by distributing their equipment and loose
mission model(s) provided in home between
the two home areas. Next, they place their robot into the launch area they wish to start
from. Any remaining time should be used to
adjust the robot and equipment for the first
launch, to calibrate sensors using any part
of the mat, and to ask the referee to check
anything on the field.
Team members must then divide into two
groups and position one group on each side
of the field (left and right). These members
cannot switch sides during the match.
Teams of:
a. Four or more: Position two technicians
at each home area. All other team members
must stand back. Teams may never have more
than two technicians at a single home area,
but a team members may swap places with a
technician from the same side at any time.
b. Three: Position two technicians on one side
and one on the other (team choice).
c. Two: Position one technician on each side.8.
9.
10.11.
When launching:
• Technicians may not keep anything
from moving.
• The robot and anything it is about to move
must fit completely inside the launch area.14.
16 Robot Game Rulebook I RulesDURING THE MATCH | INSIDE HOME
Home is divided into two sections, each with
its own launch area. Technicians may use
their hands to handle the robot, equipment,
and mission models when these items are
completely within their respective home area.
Technicians may not:
• Hand anything from one home area
to the other.
• Touch anything outside of their home area,
except for interrupting the robot.
• Cause anything to move or extend outside
this area, except for launching the robot.
Points scored in these ways will not count.12.
13.
UNEARTHEDTM17DURING THE MATCH | OUTSIDE HOME
After any launch, technicians should allow the robot
and anything it is in contact with to return completely
into home before interrupting it.
If technicians interrupt the robot, it must be
relaunched. If the robot or any object it was
in contact with during the interruption was
outside home (even partly), the team loses one
precision token.
a. Partly outside home: If the robot or any
object it was in contact with at the time of
interruption is partly outside the home area,
they must be returned to that same
home area.
b. Completely outside home: If the robot and
all objects it was in contact with are completely
outside of home at the time of interruption, the
team may place them in either home area.
The team keeps the robot and any objects it
originally launched with. However, any objects
obtained outside of home after the robot’s last
launch must be handed to the referee for the
remainder of the match.
Exception: If the team does not intend to
launch again, they may stop their robot in place
without losing a precision token. The robot and
anything it is in contact with should remain in
place where it was interrupted.
Teams may not interrupt their robot in such a
way that they earn points from it. Points scored
in these ways will not count.If a piece of equipment or a mission model is
dropped or left outside of home by the robot,
wait for it to come to rest. If it rests:
a. Completely outside home: It stays as is
unless the robot moves it.
b. Partly inside home: It stays as is unless
the robot moves it. Alternatively, at any time,
the technicians may remove it by hand. If the
object removed by hand is a mission model, it
must be given to the referee for the remainder
of the match. If the object is equipment, it must
be taken into that home area, and the team will
lose one precision token.
Teams may not separate the Dual Lock, take
models apart, or break a mission model. Points
scored in these ways will not count.
If a mission model is combined with anything
(including the robot), the combination must
be loose or simple enough that a technician
can free the mission model in perfect original
condition in a single motion, if requested.
Points scored using combinations that fail this
test will not count.
Teams may not interact with the opposing
team’s field, robot, equipment, or any mission
models/interactions that span both fields
unless there is a mission exception. Points
failed or lost due to interference will score
automatically for the other team.15.

18 Robot Game Rulebook I RulesAFTER THE MATCH | SCORING
GRACIOUS PROFESSIONALISM ® AT THE ROBOT GAME After 2.5 minutes, the match ends. Technicians
must stop their robot and touch nothing else.
This is when scoring begins.
For scoring, all mission requirements must be
visible at the end of the match unless a method
was required in the mission.
When something is required to be “in” an area,
the lines and airspace above that area count
as “in” unless otherwise mentioned.If a team cannot run their robot, they can still
gain Gracious Professionalism® points by
explaining the situation or being present
at the match.
The referee will document the results of the
match with the team. When there is agreement
on the results, it becomes official. If no
agreement is reached, the head referee makes
the final decision. Only the team’s best score
of the three official matches counts toward
awards and advancement. Ties are broken
using second and third best scores. In the case
of a three-way tie, local tournament officials will
decide what to do.21.
22.
23.24.
25.
Gracious Professionalism points will be added to the
total Core Values score from judging.
Every team starts each match with an
ACCOMPLISHED score (3 points), and this is the
score most matches will yield. The score changes
only if a referee observes above-and-beyond
sportsmanship, awarding an EXCEEDS score
(4 points), or lesser sportsmanship, awarding a
DEVELOPING score (2 points).If a team does not show up for their match, they
will score no points for Gracious Professionalism .
However, if a team arrives and does not run the robot
but does explain what has happened, they can get a
Gracious Professionalism score of 2, 3, or 4 points
depending on the Gracious Professionalism they
demonstrate.DEVELOPING ACCOMPLISHED EXCEEDSDownload
