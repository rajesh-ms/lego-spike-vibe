ROBOT GAME
RULEBOOK
Engineering Notebook I Getting Started
4Get ready to dig deep into history as this year’s
UNEARTHEDTM robot game takes you on an exciting
archaeological adventure. Your team will explore a
dig site, carefully excavating artifacts hidden beneath
layers of rock and soil and uncovering clues that reveal
stories of past civilizations. As you journey farther into the dig, you’ll encounter
more challenging terrain, including fragile ruins and
delicate artifacts that require precision to retrieve
without damage. Along the way, you’ll decode
mysteries and help to share the stories they tell.
Prepare to unearth hidden treasures and piece
together the past as you embark on this thrilling
journey of discovery!
Build your mission models and identify your mission strategy.
Each mission and model connect to discoveries and tools found on an archaeological dig site. It’s up to your team
which missions you will attempt, and you can attempt them in any order. Remember that the models and missions
can also serve as inspiration for your innovation project topic.
Design and create your autonomous robot and programs.
Create a plan for your robot design that is supported by your mission strategy. Build a robot and any attachments
using LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime or any permitted LEGO Education-compatible set. Code your robot to
complete a series of missions autonomously in a 2.5-minute robot game to score points.
Test and iterate on your robot solution to complete missions.
Iterate on your robot design and programs with continual testing and improvements. Be sure to record the changes
you make along the way, including what works and what doesn’t work. These notes will be helpful for your team as
you progress through the season and for when you share your robot design with the judges.
Communicate your robot design process.
Use the rubrics to help you prepare a short presentation that clearly explains the process your team used to create
your robot and programs and how they work. Include how each person on the team contributed and what skills they
learned along the way.
Compete in robot game matches.
Whether practicing or competing, your robot starts in
a launch area. Your team can attempt missions in any
order and return the robot to either home location.
Your team will play three matches, but only your
highest score is used for awards.Design and create a robot that will complete
missions in the robot game.Robot Design and Robot Game

Start here . . .
Identify and research a problem faced by archaeologists.
Use the Project Sparks page to guide your selection of an archaeological problem.
Conduct research to explore the existing solutions to that problem. What has already been tried? What
challenges remain? Try to use a variety of sources to support your work.
You may want to create something new, apply existing technology from another field of study, or improve
on an existing solution; that’s what innovation is all about.
Develop a plan to improve your ideas. It may be necessary to change or update parts of your solution as
you learn more from testing your ideas or sharing them with others.
Think about . . .
Review the rubrics and the judging flowchart.
At the event, you will have a limited amount of time to share how you developed your solution, including
what you learned in research and testing. The rubrics help your team understand what to focus on when
presenting to the judges. They will be interested in the progress you and your team have made this
season, even if the work is still underway.
Create a prototype model or drawing that represents your innovative solution to help explain it to others
and to the judges. Keep in mind that whether your problem is big or small, the impact of your solution
could be huge.
Before the event . . .
Prepare a live presentation to communicate your solution.
Think about how your team will summarize your work. The judges will ask questions when they want to
know more and will provide the team with feedback. Your presentation should explain the problem you
selected, the research you did, and how you developed your solution.
To help the judges understand your team’s journey, highlight how you used Core Values to make
progress and solve challenges along the way. Finish by sharing how your innovative solution would help
archaeologists piece together the stories of the past.
Make sure your whole team is involved in sharing your progress. Check out our event preparation video
found in the season resources to learn more about the judging session. In the UNEARTHED™ season, your team’s
challenge is to identify a problem faced by
archaeologists and propose a solution that
can help. Archaeologists use the archaeological process to
reconstruct and understand the artifacts they have
unearthed. Whether they are excavating a site or
studying materials in a laboratory, it takes people working together with technology to find the clues
needed to understand how past generations lived,
learned, and celebrated.

Project Sparks
Today’s date is the 5th of August, 2025. A team of
archaeologists has been documenting their discoveries at a
new dig site. Their field notes contain information that is useful
for understanding the people who lived here a long time ago.
During an excursion, the team discovers an ancient map
leading them to believe more artifacts will be found nearby.
How will the archaeology team identify where
additional artifacts are located?
What solutions exist
to solve the problems
described in the field
notes? Has your team
encountered a different
problem in the field of
archaeology?
Members of the excavation team want to explore nearby
caves and account for changes in the landscape that occurred
over time.
How can the team use technology to create a modern-day
map of the cave and full site?
Once excavation begins, the team starts to find artifacts related
to everyday life. Some are sturdy and large, like millstones used
to process grains, and others are smaller, like coins and beads.
What tools can the team use to get these items out of the
ground without damaging or losing any of them?
The archaeologists have evidence that the people who once
lived here were very connected to water and all it would provide.
Parts of sculptures found near a forum depict animals from the
water, but locating all the pieces and restoring them will be a
significant challenge.
How can the team improve the restoration process?
An artifact was discovered that
has left everyone on the team
wanting to know more, but not
every mystery can be solved by
one team on its own.
How can archaeologists work
with teams in other careers to
solve the mysteries together?

Scoring MaterialsRubrics & Scoresheets
FIRST® LEGO® League is evaluated equally in
four areas: Core Values, Innovation Project, Robot
Design, and Robot Game. Judges will use rubrics and
referees will use scoresheets to assess your work
and provide feedback.
The rubrics outline what judges are looking for during
your session, and the flowchart shows the order you
should present your work. It is your team’s job to
explain everything to the judges during the session.
Judges may ask questions to learn more and will give
feedback at the end of the session.
Judging Rubrics Class Pack Rubric
During the robot game, referees will use
scoresheets to record your results. You’ll
have multiple matches to try your mission
strategy, and only your highest score will
count.
Core Values are evaluated both in judging
and during the robot game. In the judging
session, your team will share how you
applied Core Values throughout your season.
During the robot game, referees will observe
how your team demonstrates Gracious

smoothly at the dig site. They help keep the people
and supplies organized so the team can work
efficiently. If something exciting happens, the site
manager might be the first person called.
Site Manager
A conservator is an expert in fixing and protecting
artifacts so they can be studied for a long time. When
artifacts are found by archaeologists, they might be
dirty, damaged, or in multiple pieces. Conservators may
have to work quickly because some artifacts will fall
apart if they are not treated carefully.
Conservator
Geologists help at dig sites because they are experts
in rocks and soil. They can use technology to figure
out how old the rocks are to help understand how the
site has changed over time.

Archaeologists are storytellers of the past.
Archaeologists do lots of different jobs to help
people learn about the past. They may do research,
excavate or dig up treasures from underground, study
in a lab, or manage collections of ancient artifacts.
Archaeologist
Lab technicians help organize the items that
archaeologists find. They carefully clean and
measure the objects, and sometimes they put broken
pieces back together like a puzzle. Microscopes,
cameras, and 3D printers are some of the equipment
that may be used in the lab.
Lab Technician
Anthropologists are interested in how people lived
in the past. They work closely with archaeologists to
study human history and how people have changed
over time. They study human-made artifacts and use
clues from the site to interpret how the objects were
used long ago.
