3Intro to FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge
Friendly competition is at the
heart of FIRST® LEGO® League
Challenge, as teams of up to 10
children engage in research,
problem-solving, coding, and
engineering as they build and code
a LEGO® robot that navigates the
missions of the robot game.
Teams also participate in an
innovation project to identify and
propose a solution to a relevant
real-world problem.FIRST LEGO League Challenge
is one of three divisions by age
group of the FIRST LEGO League
program. This program inspires
young people to experiment and
grow their confidence, critical
thinking, and design skills through
hands-on learning. FIRST LEGO
League was created through an
alliance between FIRST® and
LEGO® Education.
FIRST® AGE™ presented by Qualcomm and UNEARTHED ™
Robots. LEGO bricks. Game
pieces. Tools. Team T-shirts.
Volunteer pins. Engineering
notebooks. Pizza boxes. Banners.
Remove the people from a FIRST
community event, and these are
some of the objects you might see
left behind. They are the artifacts
future archaeologists can use to put
together the pieces of the FIRST
story.
Archaeology helps uncover
cultural histories through the
study of artifacts. The field provides insight into how living beings have
interacted with our planet and
each other throughout history.
It reconstructs the stories of our
communities so we can learn from
our past.
During our archaeology-inspired
season, FIRST teams and
supporters will use STEM and
collaboration skills to unearth new
findings about ourselves and our
collective communities to help build
a better world. Dig in with FIRST!

Team Meeting Guide I Getting Started30Prepare for the Event
It’s normal to feel like there’s still so much to do as your first event approaches. The most important thing is to
strive to complete as much as possible and come ready to share what you’ve accomplished so far. Whether it’s
your robot design, innovation project, or Core Values, your event will give you new ideas and inspiration to keep
building on what you’ve started.
If there is too much information for the team to cover in detail, visual aids can be very useful references. Make sure
the team practices how they will use them in the judging session, keeping in mind the time limits for sharing their
innovation project and robot design work.

31Final Checkpoint
Finished with Your Season?
Here are some suggestions for wrapping
up after your team’s last event:
• Hold a team celebration!
• Have the team share
their experience with
friends and classmates.
• Have the team continue
developing their
innovation project.
• Discuss your rubric
scores and feedback
received.• Clean up and take apart
the robot and mission
models.
• Allow time for the
team to reflect on their
experience.
• Inventory the LEGO®
set to make sure all the
pieces are there.The goal of a Challenge event is for the team to celebrate their hard work, compete to the
best of their ability, share what they have learned, and, most importantly, have fun! Here
are some helpful steps to help your team prepare.
Determine what type of event you’re attending
and identify the organizer of your event. If you
purchased a Class Pack, the event will be your
responsibility. Check out the Class Pack Guide for
more details.
Decide how your team will get to the event. Confirm
what time they need to arrive and how long they
are expected to stay. Encourage families and
caregivers to attend if possible.
Review the details and requirements for the event
you are attending. They can vary depending on the
type of event.
Ensure each team member knows the key aspects
of your work and can contribute to explaining it
according to the rubrics. You could also practice
presenting your work with an adult or another team
for feedback. Have the team prepare a checklist of materials
that are needed for the event, including your robot
and attachments, innovation project materials, and
any scripts or robot programming notes.
Take a moment to reflect, celebrate how far you’ve
come, and get excited to share your progress.
Every team starts somewhere, and your event is a
chance to grow, learn, and have fun!
Remind the team that FIRST® LEGO® League is
about the process of learning, experimenting, and
improving. Participating in your first event is an
important step in this process.
At the event, encourage the team to engage with
other teams to share what they have learned and to
support each other.
