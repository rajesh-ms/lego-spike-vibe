112-Week FIRST LEGO League “Unearthed” Challenge Curriculum (Spike Prime Focus) 
Welcome to a comprehensive week-by-week guide for coaching a returning FIRST LEGO League (FLL) Challenge team through the 2025–2026 “UNEARTHED” season. This curriculum is tailored for an experienced team, emphasizing an accelerated two-phase timeline (Foundation and Intensive Development) and focusing exclusively on the SPIKE™** Prime** robot platform (block-based programming). It integrates Robot Game strategy (all 13 missions), the Innovation Project (archaeology-themed), and continuous reinforcement of FLL Core Values, with added competition prep to polish the team for judging and matches. All 24 sessions (12 weeks, 2 sessions/week, ~1 hour each) include a Coach’s Plan and Kids’ Activities & Outcomes, plus suggested templates for planning and team organization. 
 
Guide Structure: 
Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2: Foundation & Exploration): Rapidly cover game rules, field setup, and core values; brainstorm robot design and project ideas; build a basic SPIKE Prime chassis. 
Phase 2 (Weeks 3–12: Intensive Development & Refinement): Iteratively design attachments and code to tackle all missions; develop and refine the Innovation Project solution (research, prototype, expert input, presentation); integrate competition prep (judging practice, timed robot runs) and core values activities weekly. 
Balanced Approach: In FLL Challenge, Robot Game, Innovation Project, Robot Design, and Core Values are equally weighted (each ~25%) in judging 1. This curriculum ensures progress in all areas each week. Sessions typically split time between robot tasks (design, build, program, strategy) and project tasks (research, solution development, presentation), while weaving in team-building and Core Values reflection. As a returning team, you’ll accelerate through basics and quickly move into advanced problem-solving, aiming to maximize scoring potential and polish the team’s collaborative skills. 
 
 
Phase 1: Foundation & Exploration (Weeks 1–2) 
In the first two weeks, the team rapidly gains understanding of the UNEARTHED challenge and lays the groundwork for the season. They will build the field and a basic robot, learn the Robot Game rules, explore the theme (archaeology) and Core Values, and start brainstorming both mission strategies and Innovation Project ideas. By the end of Week 2, the team should have a functioning base robot chassis, a list of potential project problems (related to uncovering or preserving the past), and a solid grasp of how FLL works (for any new members). This phase sets a fast pace, leveraging the team’s prior experience to cover fundamentals quickly. 
 
Week 1: Kickoff & Team Orientation 
Focus: Introduce the season’s theme and objectives, build the field kit, review Robot Game rules and Core Values, and get the team comfortable working together. Begin brainstorming robot design and project ideas. 
Session 1: Season Introduction & Field Setup 
Coach’s Plan: Prepare to introduce the UNEARTHED challenge storyline and objectives. Show the official Season Reveal video and/or any theme introduction materials 2 to excite the team about archaeology and what “Unearthed” means. Review the Robot Game Rulebook (highlight key rules like the 2.5-minute match, start/launch area, no touching robot outside base, etc.) and the list of 13 missions on the field. Emphasize that this year’s missions relate to archaeology (e.g. excavating artifacts, rebuilding historical objects). Have the mission model building instructions ready (printed or on a tablet) 3 and the Challenge mat unrolled on a table or floor. Gather the SPIKE Prime kit and expansion set 4, plus any spare parts if available (being a returning team, they may have last year’s robot as reference). Also prepare a brief Core Values overview to remind the team of FIRST’s values and the concept of Gracious Professionalism® 5. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Challenge Exploration: Watch the season intro video and discuss the archaeology theme – What kinds of “hidden treasures or stories” might FLL be focusing on? Kids should get excited about digging into the past as described by FIRST 6. Have them flip through the Engineering Notebooks (or any provided season handbook for team members) to see theme background and “Project Sparks” (inspiration prompts) 7. 
Field Setup: The team builds the mission models from the Challenge Set. Divide the model kits among team members to build simultaneously (assign 2–3 kids per model if necessary). As they build, encourage them to identify each mission by name/goal – e.g. “Angler Artifacts”, “Statue Rebuild”, “Silo”, etc., and roughly what the robot is expected to do for each. By session end, aim to have most mission models built and attached to the mat in the proper locations 8. Kids should also inspect how each model works (what moves, what triggers a scoring action) using the rulebook descriptions 9. This hands-on setup naturally leads to questions about mission rules, which is a great opportunity to discuss them. 
Core Values Icebreaker: Do a quick team icebreaker emphasizing teamwork (one of the Core Values). For example, a “one-word story” circle where each team member contributes one word to collectively tell a fun story about an archaeological dig – demonstrating collaboration and inclusion. Conclude by having each kid share something they’re excited to “discover” this season, tying back to the Core Value of Discovery. By the end of Session 1, the team should feel united and informed about the season’s scope. 
Session 2: Rules, Strategy Brainstorm & Chassis Build 
Coach’s Plan: Before this session, review any Game Update/Clarifications (since kickoff) in case FIRST has answered questions about missions 10. Plan to recap key Robot Game rules (e.g. scoring, penalties, updates) and facilitate an initial strategy discussion. Prepare a simple SPIKE Prime base robot design to build – this could be a basic drive base from SPIKE’s app or a proven design like the “Coop Bot” or similar (which is a modular Spike Prime base requiring core + expansion set) 11. If the team’s previous robot is available, decide if you’ll reuse it or improve it; otherwise, building a fresh chassis is a great exercise. Also prepare a chart paper or whiteboard for mission brainstorming (listing all missions and possible approaches). 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Robot Game Rule Review: The team quickly reviews Robot Game basics: point values, how missions are scored, and any special rules (e.g., use of precision tokens for penalties). Quiz the kids with a few scenarios (“What happens if the robot touches a model outside Base?”) to ensure understanding. Encourage experienced members to share examples from last season, reinforcing learning for any new teammates. 
Mission Strategy Blitz: Now that the field is built, the team does a “mission brainstorm”. Walk around the field and list all 13 missions on the board. For each mission, ask kids to think of possible ways to solve it or if it seems easy vs. hard. Don’t deep-dive into solutions yet; just mark missions that look high priority (for example, ones worth big points or sitting near Base). The goal is to develop a rough mission gameplan: identify a few “low-hanging fruit” missions that are easy and high-yield, versus complex ones that need more thought. This helps inform what attachments the robot might need (pusher, claw, lift, etc.). 
Build Basic Chassis: The team starts assembling their robot base. If reusing last year’s robot, spend time inspecting it: what worked well, what could be improved (e.g., stability, motor placement)? If building new, use a known design or instructions. An example is the “Coop Bot” chassis, a sturdy SPIKE Prime base designed for FLL missions 12. It features two drive motors, a castor or ball for balance, mounting points for attachments, and optionally two color sensors in front (helpful for line following) 13 14. Aim to have the base chassis mostly built by the end of the session – i.e., drivetrain is assembled and robot can roll. Save advanced components (sensors, attachment mechanisms) for later sessions if time is short. 
Core Values Focus: As the robot comes together, highlight Inclusion and Teamwork – everyone should contribute, whether by building, fetching parts, or reading instructions. The outcome of Session 2 is a partially built robot chassis and an initial mission strategy outline. The team should also have a team name by now, if they didn’t already – something fun that bonds them (a returning team might refresh their name or cheer). Consider creating a team poster with the name and maybe listing each member’s personal goal for the season (fostering Innovation and Fun values). 
 
Week 2: Basic Training & Concept Development 
Focus: Now that the basics are in place, week 2 solidifies the foundation. The team finishes setting up the robot and field, learns how to program the SPIKE Prime for fundamental movements and sensor use (an accelerated “Robot Training Camp”), and narrows down an Innovation Project problem to solve. By the end of this week, the robot can drive and perhaps use a sensor, and the team has chosen a specific project topic in the archaeology theme to research in depth. Core Values and teamwork skills continue to be reinforced as the group starts tackling problems together. 
Session 3: SPIKE Prime Programming 101 & Project Ideas 
Coach’s Plan: This session is akin to a robot programming workshop. Make sure the SPIKE Prime hub is charged and the programming device (laptop/tablet) is set up with the SPIKE App. Prepare a few basic programming challenges (using block coding) to teach essential skills: e.g., moving a certain distance, turning, using the gyro or color sensor. The official materials refer to this as “Training Camp 1: Driving Around” 15 – you can mirror that by guiding the team through a simple drive-forward program and perhaps a loop or sensor block. Also identify one easy mission model on the field that the team can interact with for practice (for example, a mission where the robot just needs to push or reach something). Additionally, come with resources for the Innovation Project: the project theme details and examples. Facilitate a brainstorm to generate project ideas: since the season is archaeology-focused, the project should involve identifying a real-world problem related to exploring or preserving the past. Be ready with a few “Project Sparks” or prompts (the challenge documents often provide prompts) to inspire the kids 16 – e.g., How might we protect ancient artifacts? How could technology help archaeologists? Also prepare a method for idea selection (like dot voting) to help them converge on one idea by session’s end. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Finish Robot Build: If any parts of the base robot were unfinished, the team completes assembly (e.g., mounting sensors, securing cables). Ensure the SPIKE Prime brick connects to the programming device. Celebrate when the robot is “alive” and ready to code. 
Basic Coding Drills: The kids start programming with SPIKE Prime’s block language. As a first exercise, have them write a simple program to drive the robot forward and back a specific distance (e.g., 30 cm forward, then stop) – this covers motor movement blocks and possibly using the built-in motor rotation sensor to measure distance. Next, introduce a turn (e.g., turn 90 degrees) so they learn to coordinate motors. If the team is comfortable, introduce using the gyro sensor to turn accurately, or the color sensor to detect the black lines on the mat. For instance, challenge them to program the robot to “move until it sees a black line” on the field – a common FLL technique 17. This uses a loop or wait block with the color sensor input, and teaches them to integrate sensor feedback in code. By doing these mini-exercises, the team refreshes their coding know-how (or learns quickly by doing). Each kid or pair can take turns at the keyboard, or split into sub-teams tackling different tasks (one doing straight moves, another figuring out the turn). The outcome should be a basic driving program and possibly a demonstrated ability to stop at a line or follow a line edge for a short distance. These skills will be directly useful for missions. 
Innovation Project Brainstorm: Shift focus to the project. Recap that the Innovation Project requires identifying a problem related to the season theme and designing an innovative solution, which they will later present to judges 18. The team should throw out ideas in a brainstorming session: encourage free thinking, no idea is too silly at this stage. For “Unearthed,” ideas might range from “a device to help archaeologists dig without damaging artifacts” to “an app to bring ancient stories to life for kids.” Have one member record all ideas. Aim to generate a good list, then discuss each idea’s pros/cons briefly. By end of brainstorm, try to narrow down to 2-3 favorite project ideas that seem both interesting and feasible. (The team will research these outside of meeting time if possible, or as “homework.”) 
Core Values Check-in: After a technical coding session, take a short break for a team-building exercise that reinforces communication. For example, have the kids pair up to guide each other through a simple obstacle course blindfolded (or with eyes closed) using only verbal instructions – metaphoric for how precise the robot programming needs to be, and highlighting trust and communication. Debrief how this relates to Teamwork and Communication (a life skill FLL fosters 19). The outcome of Session 3 is a driving robot with initial programs and a focused list of project concepts to investigate. 
Session 4: Sensors & Strategy; Pick Project Problem 
Coach’s Plan: This session wraps up Phase 1 by solidifying sensor programming skills and making strategic decisions. Plan a continuation of the “Training Camp” with a focus on using sensors and attachments – e.g., “Training Camp 3: Reacting to Lines” and object manipulation, as per FIRST’s guide 20. Set up a scenario to use the color sensor or ultrasonic (distance) sensor if available: perhaps have the robot follow a line for a short path or stop at a certain color marking (some mats have colored areas) 21. Also, if the robot chassis is ready, you can attach a simple arm or plow attachment to test moving a mission model. Meanwhile, be ready to guide the team in choosing one Innovation Project problem out of the brainstormed ideas – likely the one that resonates most or has the most potential. Gather some quick facts or visuals for those top ideas to help inform their choice (e.g., if one idea was protecting cave paintings, have a quick stat about a challenge in archaeology they can solve). Finally, prepare to introduce the concept of project research – how to systematically learn more about their chosen problem. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Advanced Robot Practice: The team extends their programming skills. If they started line following or sensor work in Session 3, now push it further. For example, create a small test on the field: Can you program the robot to drive forward until it reaches the first black line on the mat, then make a left turn precisely 90°? They’ll need to combine movement blocks with sensor conditionals (using the color sensor to detect the line) and maybe utilize the gyro for an accurate turn. This mimics real mission requirements where alignment is crucial. Another task: use the medium motor (if SPIKE Prime has one attached) to make a simple attachment movement, such as lowering an arm. For instance, if there’s a mission to lift or push something (like “Tip the Scales” mission), have them prototype how an attachment might work – e.g., program the arm motor to move 45° downward to push a lever. This introduces the idea of modular attachments that can be added or removed for different missions (designing the robot in modular way is key for efficiency 22). By practicing a basic attachment motion, the kids learn how to control multiple motors and time actions. They should also calibrate sensors if needed (like ensure the color sensor can reliably distinguish the mat’s black lines from other colors). At this stage, the robot might complete a simple combined task like “drive forward, follow a line, then stop in front of Mission X.” This is a big milestone – it means the team can now start tackling actual missions next phase with some confidence. 
Select Project Problem: Revisit the short-listed project ideas from last session. Ask the team: which idea are they most excited about? Which seems like a problem they could realistically research and innovate on in the given time? Use a democratic method (like each kid ranks the ideas) or consensus to pick ONE clear project problem to pursue. Once decided, define it explicitly. For example: “Our project problem: Archaeologists often damage artifacts when excavating – we will find a solution to excavate carefully.” It could be any well-scoped issue in the archaeology theme. This decision is important as it focuses their research moving forward. Encourage the team by showing enthusiasm for their choice and perhaps brainstorming a team slogan or hashtag around it (fun element to boost identity and Fun Core Value). 
Plan Project Research: Now that a problem is chosen, have the team list what they need to learn to solve it. For instance, “What techniques/tools do archaeologists use today? What are the limitations? Has anyone tried to solve this before?” Assign research tasks that kids can do before next week (each team member or pair takes a question to investigate via internet or library). Also discuss who could be a good expert to talk to (e.g., a local archaeologist, a museum curator, a professor). Identifying an expert now is great, so you can schedule a visit or call by mid-season. The kids should also start thinking of potential solutions in the back of their minds, but emphasize first understanding the problem deeply (discovery and impact first, innovation later 23). 
Core Values & Teamwork: As Phase 1 concludes, reflect on the team’s progress. Have a brief roundtable: “What was one thing another teammate did that helped you this week?”. This reflection encourages gratitude and Gracious Professionalism – recognizing each other’s contributions positively 24. For fun, you might introduce a Core Values poster in the room where the team can add sticky notes each week noting examples of values in action (building a visual record of their teamwork). The outcome of Session 4 is a confident team ready to dive into full mission and project work, with their robot driving reliably and their project problem defined and primed for research. 
 
Phase 2: Intensive Development & Refinement (Weeks 3–12) 
Phase 2 spans the remaining 10 weeks and is where the meat of the work happens. In this phase, the team will iteratively build and program solutions for all 13 robot missions and develop their Innovation Project from concept to final presentation. The approach is incremental: each week the team will tackle a subset of missions, design or refine attachments, and add code, while simultaneously conducting project research or developing their solution and prototype. Core Values practices continue, and competition preparation elements (judging practice, robot run-throughs, etc.) ramp up as the tournament approaches (especially in the final weeks). The timeline below outlines major milestones the team should hit: 
 
Throughout Phase 2, encourage iterative improvement: design-test-improve cycles are fundamental. Remind the kids that it's normal if missions don't work on first try – identify why and improve (this is real engineering!). Keep tying activities back to Core Values: celebrate innovation when a clever solution emerges, emphasize inclusion by ensuring all team members have a role in both robot and project work, and keep the atmosphere fun even as the workload increases. 
Weeks 3–4: Attacking Missions & Research Deep Dive 
Focus: Now in “full swing,” the team concentrates on Robot Game mission development and serious research for the project. In these two weeks, aim to get a handful of missions (perhaps 3–5) reliably solved by the robot and to solidify the project’s direction by researching existing solutions and formulating an innovative idea. It’s also time to start thinking about robust attachment design – modular tools that can be swapped on the robot for different tasks. By end of Week 4, the base robot should be essentially complete (chassis tuned, sensors working, maybe a gyro for accuracy) and several mission programs should be functioning on the field. The team should also decide on a specific project solution concept to develop, based on their research findings. 
Session 5: First Mission Mode & Research Planning 
Coach’s Plan: Identify one of the simpler missions as the team’s first to fully solve – ideally a mission near the home base with minimal complex action (for example, a mission where the robot just needs to push an object into a scoring area or deliver something). Common strategy is to tackle easy missions first to build confidence. Prepare the detailed Mission description and rules for that mission (from the rulebook) so the team understands exactly what constitutes success and any constraints 25. Also, prepare materials for the Innovation Project research: perhaps printouts of articles or examples related to their chosen problem, and possibly a list of existing solutions or attempts (what do people do today about that problem?). If you haven’t yet, now is a good time to introduce the official Project Rubric (so the team knows what judges look for: problem identification, innovative solution, research, etc.) and make a research plan. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Solve First Mission: The team focuses on programming and testing a complete mission. For instance, if the first mission is “Angler Artifacts” (hypothetical example: robot needs to grab a fish artifact and bring it back), the kids design an attachment or mechanism to accomplish it – maybe a claw or a scoop. They likely prototype something using the SPIKE Prime kit pieces: e.g., a simple lever arm that snaps onto the front of the robot to hook the artifact. They then write a program: drive to the artifact’s location (perhaps following a line or using a consistent angle turn from base), lower the arm to capture it, then return to base. This will require multiple iterations: measure distances on the mat, tune motor power for consistency, test if the attachment reliably grabs the object. It’s normal that the first few tries fail or something misaligns. Encourage the team to debug systematically: if the robot misses the object, is it an aiming issue (adjust turn angle) or an attachment issue (doesn’t hook properly)? They should refine the attachment (maybe add a guide or rubber piece for grip) and adjust the code. By session end, Mission 1 should be completed successfully at least once. They should document this success (e.g., write in their engineering notebook what solution they built and how many points it earns). This victory sets the stage for tackling harder missions. 
Additional Attachment Brainstorm: Solving the first mission will spark ideas for others. As time permits, have the team sketch or discuss what attachments/tools the robot might need for other missions (e.g., a lifting arm for “Statue Rebuild” or a plow for clearing debris). Encourage modular design – perhaps the attachment base can stay consistent and just different end-effectors are swapped 26. No need to build them all now, but having a plan (maybe a list of missions and a proposed attachment type for each) is useful. 
Project Research Plan: Transition to project work. The team should start researching the current state of their problem. If their problem was “damaging artifacts during excavation,” for example, what methods do archaeologists currently use and what are the shortcomings? Each member (or pair) can share any findings from their “homework” or do a quick supervised internet search during the meeting. Gather the facts: what causes the problem, who is affected, existing solutions or technologies related to it, etc. Often teams will discover that professionals have some tools but they might be expensive or not fully effective. This research phase aligns with the Identify and Research steps in the project requirements 27. Capture notes on a board or Google Doc that the team can refer to later. By the end of Session 5, the team should have a clearer picture of the problem and maybe some insight into what gaps or opportunities exist for their innovative solution. Decide on next steps: maybe identify an expert to contact or specific aspects to research deeper. Assign any follow-up research tasks for the kids to do before the next session. 
Core Values – Respect & Impact: During this flurry of technical work, note moments of cooperation: e.g., two kids who combined their attachment ideas to make a better design, or someone who stepped aside to let another try a coding idea. Praise these in the context of Impact (one of the core values) – their collaborative behavior is impacting the team’s success positively 28. You might also do a quick “rose and thorn” where each team member says one thing that went well (rose) and one challenge (thorn) in solving the mission. This encourages open communication and a continuous improvement mindset (a growth mindset fosters Innovation and Excellence). 
Session 6: Multiple Missions & Ideation of Solution 
Coach’s Plan: In this session, the team will try to extend their robot’s capabilities to more missions, and ideally by now you want to introduce the idea of a project solution. Prepare to guide them through a mission strategy discussion: which missions to attempt next, possibly how to combine tasks in one run. Also plan a mini-lesson on structured programming (maybe introduce the concept of pseudocode or flowcharting before coding a complex sequence) – this corresponds to the official “Pseudocode and Mission Strategy” session 29. For the project, gather any creative thinking tools you might use (like a mind map or design thinking exercise) to help the team brainstorm solutions now that they have researched the problem. Make sure any new parts for attachments are sorted and available – as the robot might start getting more add-ons. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Concurrent Mission Work: Divide and conquer for efficiency. The team can split into sub-teams to tackle two different missions in parallel (especially if they have more than 4 members, this works well). For example, one sub-team works on programming Mission 2 while another works on Mission 3. They can swap halfway so everyone gets experience on each. Choose missions that are independent (on different sides of the field, for instance) so one robot configuration can attempt one, and perhaps a different attachment is needed for the other. If Mission 2 (say, “Tip the Scales”) needs a ramp or specific device, those kids design that attachment and code the actions for it, while Mission 3 (say, “Map Reveal”) might just require pushing a lever, so a simpler attachment is used by the other group. This parallel approach can significantly accelerate progress but requires good communication. The coach should ensure the sub-teams share what they learn with each other – maybe at mid-session, have a quick sync where each group shows their partially working mission. By the end, aim to have at least two more missions solved (or very close to solved). It’s okay if they’re rough or not 100% consistent yet, as refinement will come later. The most important outcome is that the robot now has demonstrated solutions for ~3 missions in total, and the team is practicing how to systematically approach new challenges using the skills they’ve learned. 
Mission Strategy Refinement: With a few missions under their belt, prompt the team to think about overall strategy for the Robot Game. Which missions can be grouped in one trip? How many trips (robot returns to base) might they need in a round to cover everything? For instance, maybe Missions 1, 2, 5 are all on the east side of the mat, so they could be one “trip” if designed well. Start listing mission groupings or pairs that could be done together to save time. This strategic thinking will guide their attachment design – maybe they can create a single attachment that can handle two missions in one go, which is ideal. 
Innovation Project – Define Solution Idea: Now pivot to the project’s solution. The team has research insight by now, so ask: “Given what we learned, what could we create or propose to solve this problem?”. This is a pure creative ideation moment – encourage wild ideas, drawing from science or imagination. Use a whiteboard to sketch if helpful. For example, if the problem is damaging artifacts, possible solutions could be “a smart digging machine with sensors that detect artifacts before hitting them”, or “a special gel that hardens soil around artifacts to protect them while digging”, just anything. Let the kids build on each other’s suggestions (yes-and thinking). Eventually, try to converge on one innovative solution concept the team finds promising. It should be something they can explain and maybe prototype a part of. Once chosen, articulate it clearly: e.g., “Our solution: a Smart Trowel tool that beeps when it senses an artifact underground”. Check that it’s indeed innovative (not just something that exists identically) and that it addresses the problem they identified. This now becomes the focus of their project work. 
Plan Next Steps for Project: With a solution in mind, create a to-do list: What needs to be done to flesh out this solution? Perhaps building a prototype or model, coding a demo if it involves software, or preparing a presentation format. Also, this is a good time to identify an expert to consult about the solution idea – for example, reach out to that archaeologist or a professor and ask if the team can share their idea and get feedback in a coming session. If possible, schedule this expert interaction for a few weeks out (Week 6 or 7) so the kids have some concept to show by then. Assign roles or tasks: some kids can work on a physical prototype (e.g., assembling LEGO or craft materials to simulate the tool), others can work on a poster or slides that explain the idea, others draft questions for the expert. 
Core Values – Innovation & Persistence: A lot is happening! Take a moment to recognize the Innovation Core Value in action: the team has creatively combined their knowledge to propose a unique solution. Also, likely not everything went smoothly in the mission coding – maybe a new bug arose. Highlight how the team persisted and solved it, embodying “We use creativity and persistence to solve problems”, directly from FIRST’s values 30. End session with a fun note – perhaps a quick team cheer or a high-five chain to celebrate reaching the quarter-way mark of the season. 
Weeks 5–6: Mid-Season Development & “Feedback” 
Focus: By the middle of the timeline, the robot should be making significant progress and the project enters development of the solution. During weeks 5–6, the team works on the remaining robot missions, aiming to have at least a basic solution or approach for all missions by the end of week 6. It’s ambitious, but even having rough code/attachments for each mission means the rest of the season can be spent on improvement. This is also a great time to get external feedback: maybe arrange a session with a subject matter expert for the project or a friendly scrimmage with another team to test robot ideas. By the end of week 6, the team can do a brief assessment of where they stand: which missions are done, which need more work, and how their project solution is shaping up. This checkpoint allows re-scoping if needed (e.g., drop a very hard mission if time won't allow, or refine project scope). 
Session 7: Advanced Attachments & Remaining Missions 
Coach’s Plan: As the robot approaches tackling all missions, some of the more complex tasks are likely left for now. Pick a challenging mission and prepare to help the team break it down. Perhaps one mission requires a precise mechanism (like lifting an object onto a high platform or assembling pieces – e.g., the “Statue Rebuild” mission likely requires carefully placing parts together). Ensure the team has the expansion set parts ready – sometimes additional gears or beams are needed for these advanced attachments. If possible, show them examples of mechanisms (without giving a full design): for instance, demonstrate a simple gear lift or a claw mechanism, to inspire their design. Also encourage them to reuse and modify attachments they’ve already made (e.g., can the claw from Mission 1 be tweaked to also do Mission 7?). For programming, introduce any advanced concepts needed, like using My Blocks (custom functions) for repeated actions to simplify their code structure. Meanwhile, plan for a project check-in: by now, the team should perhaps start creating something tangible for the project (a prototype or visual aid). If the expert meeting is scheduled soon, make sure the kids have a list of questions or a short explanation of their idea prepared. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Complete Mission Portfolio: The team continues work on robot missions such that all missions have at least been attempted. They focus on those not done yet. For each remaining mission, apply the same cycle: design or pick an attachment, code a solution, test and iterate. By now, the robot might have a suite of attachments: e.g., a claw, a plow, a hook, a hopper, etc. A good practice is to create a mission-attachment chart – list each mission and which attachment (or combination) the robot will use for it. This helps ensure all missions are covered and reveals if one attachment can serve multiple missions. During this session, the team likely tackles one or two of the harder missions. For example, if “Statue Rebuild” requires stacking pieces, they might build a fork-like attachment to carry pieces and line up carefully. This could involve programming slower movements or using sensor alignment (like approaching until a touch sensor is triggered by hitting a wall, to ensure consistent positioning). They might not get it perfect yet, but even achieving partial success (such as placing one piece correctly) is progress. It’s okay if one or two missions still seem out of reach – make a note of these and consider if they might be skipped or need a creative approach later. By session end, ideally 10+ missions have some solution in progress and a few are fully done. The team’s confidence in robot design should be high now, but also they’ll notice the robot’s limitations (maybe battery is draining faster, or weight distribution is affecting turns). Encourage them to list any robot tweaks or improvements they wish to do (e.g., “make turns more reliable – maybe use gyro sensor” or “strengthen the arm so it doesn’t wobble”). These will be addressed in iteration later. 
Robot Design Discussion: At this point, pause to deliberately discuss Robot Design with the team (this is a foreshadowing of the Robot Design judging they'll face). Ask them questions like judges might: “Why did you choose this chassis design?”, “How do your attachments work?”, “How did you program the robot to align consistently?”. This gets them thinking about their engineering process and can reveal any weak spots that need addressing (for instance, if they realize they rely on luck for alignment, it may prompt employing sensors or guides). Document this discussion in their notes – it will help when writing the executive summary or talking to judges later. 
Project Prototype Work: Shift to the project and focus on developing the solution prototype. Depending on the idea, this could mean physically building something (perhaps out of LEGO, cardboard, or other craft materials) or designing a digital prototype (drawings, simulations). For a device like the “Smart Trowel,” maybe the team can repurpose an old sensor and a buzzer to simulate how it detects objects (this could be just conceptual if not buildable). The kids should at least make a mock-up that they can show. If they plan a presentation skit or demo, they could start scripting or storyboarding how to present their solution in an engaging way. They should also practice explaining their solution: what it is, how it works, and why it’s innovative. This session is a good time to prepare for meeting an expert (if one is scheduled for Session 8 or 9). Have the team role-play describing the problem and solution to someone unfamiliar, and writing down key questions they want to ask the expert (e.g., “Would a tool like this actually be useful in real digs? How could we improve it?”). 
Core Values – Inclusion & Team Roles: By now, team members may have gravitated to certain roles (one loves coding, another always builds attachments, another leads the project research). Take a moment to acknowledge everyone’s contributions and ensure inclusion: every member should try a bit of everything over the season, so they all learn. Perhaps rotate roles next session (e.g., someone new drives the robot for testing, or a builder gets to present the project idea). Remind them that everyone should understand the whole project and robot, even if they specialize – judges may ask anyone on the team about any part. This nurtures the value of Inclusion and also prepares them for competition. A quick exercise: have each student explain one part of the project or one mission to the rest, as if explaining to a judge. This builds confidence and shared understanding. 
Session 8: Testing, Feedback & Midpoint Review 
Coach’s Plan: This session marks roughly the halfway point of the 12-week plan. It’s a perfect time to do a “mid-season retrospective”. Plan to run an informal mock Robot Game round and perhaps invite a friendly volunteer or another coach to observe and provide feedback (or even another team for a mini scrimmage, if possible). Have the field set up fully and all attachments ready for a run-through of all missions the team can do so far. Also, if you arranged an expert consultation, this session could be when the expert joins to hear the project idea (alternatively, do it in Session 9). Prepare the team to present their project pitch and robot demo to this guest. If no live expert is available yet, you as a coach can simulate by stepping into a “judge” role temporarily. Gather any scoring sheets or rubrics to objectively score how things are going (you can use an official Robot Game scoresheet to tally their points so far, and the project rubric to rate their solution progress). 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Robot Game Mock Round: Set a timer for 2.5 minutes and have the team run their robot like it’s an actual match 31. They’ll need to pick which missions to attempt in that time and in what order. This is likely the first time they string multiple missions in one go without debugging in between. Expect chaos! The robot might succeed on some missions and fail on others, or attachments might be fumbled when swapping. That’s okay – this is exactly why practice is needed. After the buzzer, have the kids calculate their score using the official scoring rules (how many missions did they complete successfully, etc.). This gives a baseline. Then discuss as a team: What went wrong? Did they spend too long on one mission? Did something break? This will highlight where to focus improvements. Perhaps they realize an attachment takes too long to put on, so maybe that attachment can be redesigned to be quicker to install, or combined with another one. Or they realize the robot drifted off course – maybe they need to use more sensor guidance or slow down certain moves. This experiential learning is invaluable. It also builds their stamina for the real competition pressure. 
Robot Adjustments: After the mock round, allow time for the team to fix one or two critical issues that surfaced. For example, if mission X never worked, they might quickly adjust the code or mechanism and test it in isolation. They should not try to solve everything now – just the big pain points. Emphasize iterative improvement: “Okay, our first full run was 4 missions completed for 120 points in 2:30. Let’s aim to raise that next time.” It’s also a chance to see if any mission is consistently not working – the team might decide to put that one aside and focus on others (that’s a strategic call: sometimes skipping a problematic mission to focus on others yields a higher score overall). 
Project Feedback (Expert or Mentor): If an expert or mentor is present, the team presents their project: they explain the problem they chose and their proposed solution. Encourage the kids to do this with minimal help, as if they’re in the Project judging session. The expert/coach should ask them questions and give constructive feedback. For instance, the expert might say “Have you considered how archaeologists would carry that tool in the field?” or “This reminds me of X technology; how is yours different?” Such feedback can spark improvements. The kids should note any suggestions – perhaps it reveals they need to adjust their solution or do a bit more research on a particular aspect. If no external person is available, do a round-robin: have half the team pretend to be judges and ask questions, then switch. This not only helps improve the project but practices their presentation and Q\&A skills. 
Core Values – Coopertition® and Sharing: If you did invite another team or a guest, point out how sharing and cooperating with others can help everyone – this is Coopertition® in FLL terms (friendly cooperation in competition) 32. Compliment the team on how they handled feedback: listening respectfully and being willing to improve shows professionalism. To lighten up after the serious review, perhaps do a quick fun activity like each member shares the funniest or most surprising thing that happened so far in the season. This reinforces that, while they are working hard toward competition, they’re also having fun together – which is an FLL Core Value in itself. 
By the end of Week 6, the team should feel proud of what they’ve accomplished: a majority of missions have solutions, the project has a clear direction with an initial prototype and external input, and they have a sense of what needs work in the second half of the season. This is a crucial turning point where the focus shifts from creating to refining. 
Weeks 7–8: Iteration and Refinement 
Focus: With all missions attempted and a project solution in the works, weeks 7–8 are about improving and optimizing. The robot’s mission solutions should be iterated for greater reliability and maybe combined more efficiently. The project prototype or presentation should be refined based on any feedback (perhaps building a more polished prototype or running a demo). This is also the period to ensure all team members can explain both the robot and project clearly – so integrating “teaching moments” where kids practice describing their code or design is key. Aiming for consistency in robot runs is important now: the team will work on fine-tuning movements, possibly utilizing sensors and guide-jigs on the field to reduce variability. Core Values exercises can focus on problem-solving under pressure to simulate what might happen if things go wrong in competition. By end of Week 8, the goal is an essentially competition-ready robot and a fully developed project solution, leaving the final weeks for full-scale practice and polishing. 
Session 9: Robot Optimization & Solution Improvements 
Coach’s Plan: Now that all mission solutions exist in some form, focus this session on optimization. Identify the weakest three missions or the ones that fail most often and tackle those. Prepare to guide the team through a systematic debugging or redesign if needed. For instance, if a mission is failing 50% of the time, have them run it multiple times to gather data on what goes wrong – is it always veering left? Always just short of an object? Suggest possibly adding a reading of the gyro or sensor mid-run to self-correct (introduce the idea of a checkpoint in code, like using a line alignment halfway). If not done yet, introduce creating My Blocks (custom subroutines) for repeated tasks (like a consistent “line square-up” routine) to simplify their codebase and avoid copy-pasting code. Also emphasize the importance of a tidy code – maybe have them comment their programs or organize them in the app. For the project, plan to have the team implement any good suggestions from the feedback session. If the expert recommended a change or addition, ensure the kids consider it and possibly integrate it. For example, maybe they suggested adding a sensor to the Smart Trowel prototype – can the team simulate that with a color sensor or an LED on their prototype? Plan to also discuss the presentation format clearly now: will they do a skit, or a straight talk, or play roles (e.g., archaeologists demonstrating the tool)? Begin outlining the presentation content (they will finalize and practice it in coming sessions). 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Refine Mission Solutions: The team goes into troubleshooting mode for the robot. They likely focus on a few missions that are not meeting expectations. For each such mission, they apply iterative improvement: adjust the mechanical design or adjust the program logic. For example, they realize the robot consistently misses a target because wheel skid causes inaccuracy – so they decide to slow down the approach or use a different reference (like aligning along a wall). Or they add a second attempt in code: if the first attempt to grab an object fails (maybe detected via a sensor or simply a timing second chance), the robot backs up and tries again. These are advanced tactics that experienced teams use to make missions more robust. The kids might also optimize for speed now: if a mission is reliable but slow, can they shave off a few seconds? For instance, combining two missions in one trip might save the time of a return to base, so they practice doing that back-to-back. This might involve merging two programs and figuring out where to transition (like after finishing Mission A, reposition the robot for Mission B without returning home). Because the code is getting complex, ensure they keep backups of working versions in case an optimization breaks something. By the end of this session, the robot should be performing more consistently, with improvements made to problematic missions and possibly a quicker overall execution. They might achieve a new high score in practice, which is motivating. 
Attachment Inventory & Prep: A small but important task: have the team organize all their attachments and label them (if not already). This is both practical (so they can find and swap them quickly during matches) and part of robot design documentation – judges often appreciate seeing a clear system of attachments. The team could even create a quick reference sheet with pictures of each attachment and what missions it’s for. Creating this inventory reinforces their understanding of the entire robot system. 
Project Solution Iteration: The kids refine their innovation project. Based on any feedback, they might tweak the solution. Suppose the expert said the tool should be lighter – they can’t physically change weight in a prototype, but they might incorporate that requirement into their explanation (acknowledging trade-offs and future improvements is actually a great thing to mention to judges). They continue building out the prototype if it’s not complete or make it more presentation-ready (painting it, making sure it’s sturdy enough to handle). If they plan a digital element (like a slideshow or a video snippet to show), they gather those assets. Ensure they have evidence of their research to show judges: maybe a brief summary of what they learned from real-world experts or literature, since the project rubric values research depth and sharing with the community 33. If not already done, they could actually do a quick share activity – for example, present their idea to another class at school or a group of parents and note the feedback. This counts as “sharing their solution,” which is part of the project requirements and Core Values (Impact and Inclusion). 
Outline Presentation: It’s time to draft the structure of their 5-minute project presentation. Common formats include a skit (e.g., acting out a story that introduces the problem and solution) or a more formal briefing. Let the team decide what fits their style – returning teams often enjoy doing creative skits to stand out. Outline should include: an introduction (who they are, what the theme is), the problem description, how they researched it, their solution (with demo or prototype showcase), and a conclusion or call to action. They should also mention how they shared or plan to implement the solution. Get this outline on paper (or computer). If time permits, allocate who will talk for each part or who plays which role in a skit. 
Core Values – Teamwork under pressure: At this stage, tensions can rise when debugging tough missions or deciding presentation roles. Watch for any conflicts and use them as teachable moments. For instance, if two kids disagree on a robot approach, pause and have each articulate their reasoning, then perhaps test both ideas experimentally. Show that respectful listening and compromise are key (Core Value of Teamwork and Inclusion). You might invoke Gracious Professionalism explicitly: how would they handle such disagreements gracefully? Perhaps introduce a simple rule: when debating ideas, use “I like, I wish” format (e.g., “I like John’s idea because X, I wish we could also do Y from Jane’s idea”). This encourages finding merit in all suggestions and combining them when possible. By end of Session 9, the team should feel that both robot and project are on track, with just final polishing needed. 
Session 10: Finalizing Robot & Drafting Presentation 
Coach’s Plan: This session likely sees the robot in a near-final state. Plan to do a full test of all missions individually to verify nothing broke during recent optimizations. Essentially a checklist: mission 1 OK, mission 2 OK, ... mission 13 OK. For any still iffy missions, decide if it’s worth additional tweaking or if time suggests leaving it as is (if it’s a low point mission and taking too long to fix, maybe better to allocate time to perfecting higher-value missions). Prepare to help the team make these priority decisions using the scoring values. Also, encourage the team to start thinking about Robot Design executive summary or judging artifacts if your region requires it (some tournaments have teams fill a sheet about their robot). A simple bullet list of their robot’s key features (e.g., “two-motor differential drive, gyro for turns, color sensor for line following, 4 interchangeable attachments”) can be drafted. For the project presentation, now it’s drafting/writing time. Bring large chart paper or a laptop to write the script. If it’s a skit, help them frame it into a coherent story; if it’s a demo format, ensure they cover all rubric points (problem, solution, research, sharing, core values reflection if any). Plan to have a first full draft of the presentation by the end of this session, so it can be practiced in weeks 11–12. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Robot Polishing: The team conducts a thorough test of each mission solution, one by one. They mark any that fail and quickly try to address small fixes. At this point, changes should be minor – e.g., adjusting a speed or adding a little delay, rather than redesigning an entire attachment. They also examine the robot hardware for wear and tear: tighten any loose beams or screws, check wheels for friction issues, maybe replace batteries or ensure the rechargeable hub is holding enough charge (freshly charge it for each practice from now on to mimic competition conditions). The kids should feel that they have a reliable robot – maybe not perfect, but one they know how to operate and that can accomplish their chosen missions consistently. If a mission is still not working at all and it’s low points, consider officially dropping it to avoid wasting time – this is a strategic decision sometimes needed. They should then adjust their match gameplan accordingly (maybe they’ll ignore mission 7 and focus on others). 
Document Robot Strategy: Have the team write or record a short summary of their robot strategy and design. This is effectively preparation for the Robot Design judging. Points to include: what makes their robot special or effective? (e.g., “Our robot is very modular; we can change attachments quickly and we programmed it to realign on lines for consistency 34.”) Also mention any innovative techniques they used (like a unique attachment or a clever bit of code). This summary can serve as notes for when they talk to judges, or if required they can put it on a poster or handout. The act of summarizing also consolidates their understanding. 
Complete Project Presentation Script: The team finalizes the content of their project presentation. They divide speaking parts and write down each person’s lines or cues. For a skit, detail the scenes and who says what, including a narration of the problem and demo of the solution. Ensure the important facts from their research are included (to show they’ve done their homework) and that they clearly state how their solution is innovative. Since time is limited to 5 minutes, they should keep it concise and practice timing sections as they create them. They might realize they have too much content and need to cut or simplify some explanations – guide them to focus on the most important elements (e.g., we don’t need every stat from research, just enough to show the problem’s significance). By now, each team member should have a meaningful role in the presentation. Also include at least a brief mention of how they incorporated Core Values or worked as a team, as judges often appreciate that in the project presentation too (“Throughout our project, we worked together and even consulted an archaeologist – showing our discovery and inclusion values”). 
Prototype Final Touches: If the project solution prototype needs any final touches (paint, glue, last-minute fixes), they should finish that now so it’s ready for the practice presentations next week. If the solution cannot be physically demonstrated, perhaps prepare a short video or poster to show how it would work (some teams make a video of a concept if they can’t build it for real – this can be played or just described). 
Core Values – Preparing for Judging: Discuss how Core Values are often evaluated continuously (judges watch how the team interacts) and sometimes in a dedicated session or with a surprise teamwork challenge. Encourage them to always uphold respect and enthusiasm, even during stressful moments. Perhaps do a mock Core Values challenge: e.g., give the team a task like “build the tallest tower you can with these LEGO pieces in 5 minutes as a team” and see how they work together. Afterwards, discuss what they did well (did they include everyone? communicate?) and what they could improve (maybe someone was too bossy or someone too quiet). This prepares them for any on-the-spot teamwork exercises and reinforces their readiness to demonstrate Gracious Professionalism at the event. 
By the end of Session 10, the team is essentially event-ready on paper: robot solutions done, project solution done, presentation scripted, and core values mindset solidified. The next two weeks will be about practice, practice, practice – just like a sports team scrimmaging before the big game, they will rehearse everything to iron out any remaining wrinkles. 
Weeks 9–10: Practice and Integration 
Focus: With all content developed, these weeks are dedicated to practice and integration – bringing everything together in simulated environments to build confidence and identify any last areas for improvement. The team will practice their project presentation repeatedly, as well as run full robot game matches under timed conditions to work on flow and timing. They will also practice the Robot Design explanation for judges, ensuring each member can speak to some part of the robot/program. Essentially, weeks 9–10 turn the team into polished performers and troubleshooters: ready to handle the pressure of competition. Core Values emphasis is on celebrating progress and staying positive, reinforcing that no matter what happens at the tournament, they’ve achieved a lot as a team. By the end of week 10, the team should be performing at a competition-ready level in all areas. 
Session 11: Full Runs and Presentation Practice 
Coach’s Plan: This session should mimic an actual tournament schedule as much as possible. Plan to have the team do a complete Project Presentation run-through (with timing and any visual aids set up), followed by a Robot Design Q\&A practice, and a Core Values discussion like judges might have, and later a full Robot Game match practice. If possible, arrange for some observers (other teachers, parents, or another team’s coach) to act as judges in a mock judging session. Provide them with the official rubrics for Project, Robot Design, and Core Values so they can evaluate and then give the team feedback. Make sure the room is set up appropriately for presenting (projector or boards for them if needed). And set up the robot field as per competition standards (make sure mission models are reset correctly each time). Essentially, this is a dress rehearsal for the competition. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Mock Judging – Project Presentation: The team delivers their 5-minute project presentation in full, treating whomever is watching as judges. They should use all props, prototypes, and have any slides or posters ready. Emphasize presentation skills: speaking clearly, making eye contact, being enthusiastic. If it’s a skit, they should get into character and have fun with it (judges love to see the team’s personality). After the presentation, have the mock judges (or coach) ask them typical follow-up questions for a few minutes: e.g., “How did you come up with this solution?”, “How do you know this is a real problem?”, “Did you consider other solutions?”, “How did your team divide the work?”, etc. The kids should practice answering without looking at each other cluelessly – ideally each question can be taken by whoever feels confident, or a couple of them add on. This tests their deep understanding. It’s alright if some answers aren’t perfect; that identifies where they need clarity. For example, if they stumble on “how is this innovative?” they might need to articulate better what’s novel in their solution. The presentation and Q\&A practice will likely reveal a few spots to tweak (maybe they went over time, or a part of the explanation was unclear). Take note and adjust the script or responses as needed after the mock session. 
Mock Judging – Robot Design & Core Values: Next, simulate a Robot Design judging. This can be more free-form: have the team bring their robot with all attachments to a table and explain it to the “judges.” They should point out features (sensors, how attachments mount, any unique design choices) and might even run a short demo of a trick if space allows (or show code snippets). The judges might ask: “How did you program X?”, “Why did you use a gyro sensor here?”, “What was your design process?” 35. The team members who did the coding should be ready to talk about it, and everyone should know at least broadly how the robot works. This is where the documentation and talking points they prepared in Session 10 help. Also include a couple of Core Values questions like “How does your team handle conflicts?” or “What Core Value do you think your team exemplifies the most?” The kids can share real examples (like conflict resolution or helping another team with something). This Q\&A builds poise and ensures they won’t be caught off guard in the real judging rooms. 
Feedback and Improvement: After these mock judging exercises, the observers give feedback. The team should listen and maybe even take notes. Discuss as a team what could be improved – perhaps someone was too quiet, or they forgot to mention a critical part of the project, or the robot demo didn’t really show the coolest mechanism. Use this to refine. If no external judges were present, the coach can step out of the “coach” role and tell them frankly how they did in each area according to the rubrics 36 (e.g., did they cover all rubric points, did everyone participate, etc.). Plan to implement feedback in the next session practices. 
Robot Run Practice: Now pivot to the Robot Game. Have the team do another full 2.5-minute robot run, trying to execute their planned mission schedule. By now, they likely have a known routine: e.g., “Trip 1: do missions A, B, C, then come home; Trip 2: change attachments, do missions D, E; etc.” Time them and see if they can finish all planned missions within the match time. They should be getting better, but any new issues that pop up should be minor. Emphasize consistency and teamwork during the run: who is resetting attachments? Who is handling the robot between runs? This should be choreographed so they don’t waste time (usually 1-2 kids handle the robot on the field at competition, but ensure all know the plan). After the run, if there’s time, let them immediately try one more run to beat their score or to implement a quick fix from a mistake observed. Repetition will build their confidence. Perhaps challenge them: “Can you break 300 points?” (or whatever is a stretch goal slightly above their current best). Gamify it to keep it exciting. 
Core Values – Fun and Team Spirit: At this stage, the team might be a bit tired, so it’s crucial to keep Fun in the mix. Encourage them to come up with a team chant or cheer if they haven’t (something they can do before matches to pump up). Maybe design a goofy team handshake or give out silly awards (like “best save of the day” for someone who caught a falling attachment). These little things maintain morale. Also, remind them that no matter the outcome at competition, what matters is how much they learned and grew as a team. Perhaps have each member share the thing they’re most proud of accomplishing so far (you'll get a variety—from mastering a coding skill to speaking up in presentation practice). This reflection underscores the Success = learning & fun philosophy of FLL. 
By end of Session 11, the team has effectively rehearsed all elements of the competition, likely multiple times. They should feel the pressure easing as they realize they can do this, and well. 
Session 12: Final Rehearsal and Pep Talk 
Coach’s Plan: This is the last session before the competition (or culmination event). The primary objective is to do final run-throughs and resolve any last-minute issues. However, resist the temptation to overhaul anything major – it’s easy to get into a panic and try to redesign an attachment two days before competition, which usually does more harm than good. Instead, focus on ensuring everything is in order: the robot and attachments are in good condition, batteries charged, code backed up; project presentation is within time and all props are ready; each kid knows the schedule of the tournament day. Prepare a packing checklist for the tournament (robot, laptop, batteries/charger, spare parts, team display board, snacks, etc.). Also plan a fun celebratory element to conclude the final meeting – perhaps a small “certificates ceremony” where you hand out a certificate of achievement or a personalized note to each team member for their effort (there are official participation certificates 37 you could use, or make your own). The idea is to end on a high note, reinforcing their confidence and emphasizing that they already won by coming this far. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Polish Presentation: Do one last timed presentation run-through. By now, it should be smooth. Focus on delivery – encourage louder voices, eye contact, smiles. Maybe video record it and let them watch to self-critique, if time allows. Incorporate any tweaks from last session’s feedback (e.g., if they needed to add a line acknowledging something, ensure it’s there). Remind them to bring any physical materials for the presentation (prototype, poster, script cards if they use them) on competition day. Some teams also prepare a project report or handouts for judges – if your team did, double-check those are printed. The kids should feel proud of their project and eager to share it. Do a quick “Q\&A lightning round” for the project one more time to keep them on their toes. 
Robot Final Practice: Have the team run the robot one last time under timed conditions. Ideally, make it a no-stop, competition-realistic run (they can run it 2-3 times within this session if needed, but try to simulate the idea of one-shot performance). Don’t nitpick small errors now; the goal is to solidify their routine and get a consistent score that they are happy with. If a minor adjustment to code could significantly help consistency and they are confident about it, let them do it – but caution against any risky last-minute overhauls. This is more about the drivers/hands-on team members getting the muscle memory of swapping attachments and starting programs quickly, and others knowing their support roles (e.g., one keeps track of time or calls out which mission is next). After the final run, celebrate the achievement – perhaps it’s their best score yet, or maybe not, but either way congratulate them on getting a working robot with so many missions done. Mention how at the start of the season this was just a box of LEGO pieces and now it’s a functional engineering creation – that perspective can wow the kids about their own progress. 
Team Logistics: Go through the tournament day plan. Who will bring the robot? Do they have team shirts or coordinating outfits ready? Remind them of any key times (check-in, judging sessions, match schedules). Reiterate the importance of punctuality and staying together at the event. If any parents are helping, ensure the kids know who to look to if the coach is busy. Also, have the team tidy up their work area and pack things properly. A neat, organized kit and labeled parts can be a lifesaver if something breaks at the event – they’ll know exactly where spare parts are. 
Core Values – End with Gratitude: In a final round, ask each team member to share a favorite memory or something they learned during the season. This reflection hits on Discovery and Fun, two core values, and ends things positively. Encourage them to thank each other – maybe do a “secret teammates” where each person says one nice thing about someone else’s contribution (this could be prepared or spontaneous). Also, as a coach, share your pride in them openly. If mentors or assistant coaches helped, the team should sign a thank-you card or collectively thank them now. Instilling gratitude is part of Gracious Professionalism as well. 
Pep Talk: Finally, give a short pep talk: remind them that they are ready, that they should go into the competition confident in their work and just enjoy the experience. Win or lose, they should be courteous to other teams (maybe assign them a mission: find another team’s pit area at the event and compliment something cool they did – practicing Coopertition® 38). Maybe recall a story from last season – “Remember how last year our robot failed at X but we kept smiling and ended up with an award for teamwork? That’s the spirit to maintain.” The outcome of Session 12 is an excited, prepared team that knows exactly what to do on competition day and is ready to shine in all aspects. High-fives all around! 
 
Templates and Tools for Coaches 
To assist in executing this curriculum, here are some editable templates and resources a coach can use and adapt for their team. These include a session planning checklist, team roles assignment sheet, and a mission tracking log. Feel free to copy or adjust these for your needs: 
1. Session Preparation Checklist (Coach’s Use) – Use this before each session to ensure you have everything ready: 
[ ] Session Agenda Prepared: Key topics (robot tasks, project tasks, core values activity) defined. 
[ ] Materials Ready: Challenge documents (rules, rubrics), robot kit parts, laptop/tablet with SPIKE Prime software, mission model setup, project research printouts, etc., as needed for the day. 
[ ] Goal Set: What specific outcome should be achieved this session (e.g., “Mission 5 coded”, “project problem selected”)? 
[ ] Room & Field Setup: Table, mat, mission models in place; presentation area or whiteboard ready if needed. 
[ ] Core Values Plan: A quick game, discussion prompt, or observation focus to highlight teamwork and fun. 
[ ] Backup Plan: In case something goes awry (network issues, a key kid absent), have an alternative activity (e.g., watch an FLL tutorial video or work on engineering notebook entries). 
[ ] Post-Session Notes: After the meeting, record what was accomplished and anything to follow up on next time (useful for adjusting future plans). 
2. Team Roles & Responsibilities Chart – Ensure every team member has a primary role (or rotating roles) to foster ownership: 
Team Member 
Primary Role 
Responsibilities 
Alice 
Mechanical Designer 
Leads building of robot and attachments; ensures spare parts and tools are organized. 
Bob 
Programmer 
Writes and debugs code; keeps backup of programs; helps others learn coding. 
Charlie

Using the Guide: This 12-week curriculum is intensive, but by following it, a returning team will cover all aspects of the FLL Challenge. Remember to remain flexible – if the team masters something quickly, move on and spend more time where they need it, or if they stumble on a concept, take a bit longer to ensure understanding. The goal is not just to “win” the competition, but to develop engineering skills, project-thinking, and teamwork in a fun and meaningful way. As a coach, celebrate progress at every step. Good luck, have fun, and go get those artifacts “unearthed”! 
2-Week FIRST LEGO League “Unearthed” Challenge Curriculum (Spike Prime Focus) 
Welcome to a comprehensive week-by-week guide for coaching a returning FIRST LEGO League (FLL) Challenge team through the 2025–2026 “UNEARTHED” season. This curriculum is tailored for an experienced team, emphasizing an accelerated two-phase timeline (Foundation and Intensive Development) and focusing exclusively on the SPIKE™** Prime** robot platform (block-based programming). It integrates Robot Game strategy (all 13 missions), the Innovation Project (archaeology-themed), and continuous reinforcement of FLL Core Values, with added competition prep to polish the team for judging and matches. All 24 sessions (12 weeks, 2 sessions/week, ~1 hour each) include a Coach’s Plan and Kids’ Activities & Outcomes, plus suggested templates for planning and team organization. 
 
Guide Structure: 
Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2: Foundation & Exploration): Rapidly cover game rules, field setup, and core values; brainstorm robot design and project ideas; build a basic SPIKE Prime chassis. 
Phase 2 (Weeks 3–12: Intensive Development & Refinement): Iteratively design attachments and code to tackle all missions; develop and refine the Innovation Project solution (research, prototype, expert input, presentation); integrate competition prep (judging practice, timed robot runs) and core values activities weekly. 
Balanced Approach: In FLL Challenge, Robot Game, Innovation Project, Robot Design, and Core Values are equally weighted (each ~25%) in judging 1. This curriculum ensures progress in all areas each week. Sessions typically split time between robot tasks (design, build, program, strategy) and project tasks (research, solution development, presentation), while weaving in team-building and Core Values reflection. As a returning team, you’ll accelerate through basics and quickly move into advanced problem-solving, aiming to maximize scoring potential and polish the team’s collaborative skills. 
 
 
Phase 1: Foundation & Exploration (Weeks 1–2) 
In the first two weeks, the team rapidly gains understanding of the UNEARTHED challenge and lays the groundwork for the season. They will build the field and a basic robot, learn the Robot Game rules, explore the theme (archaeology) and Core Values, and start brainstorming both mission strategies and Innovation Project ideas. By the end of Week 2, the team should have a functioning base robot chassis, a list of potential project problems (related to uncovering or preserving the past), and a solid grasp of how FLL works (for any new members). This phase sets a fast pace, leveraging the team’s prior experience to cover fundamentals quickly. 
 
Week 1: Kickoff & Team Orientation 
Focus: Introduce the season’s theme and objectives, build the field kit, review Robot Game rules and Core Values, and get the team comfortable working together. Begin brainstorming robot design and project ideas. 
Session 1: Season Introduction & Field Setup 
Coach’s Plan: Prepare to introduce the UNEARTHED challenge storyline and objectives. Show the official Season Reveal video and/or any theme introduction materials 2 to excite the team about archaeology and what “Unearthed” means. Review the Robot Game Rulebook (highlight key rules like the 2.5-minute match, start/launch area, no touching robot outside base, etc.) and the list of 13 missions on the field. Emphasize that this year’s missions relate to archaeology (e.g. excavating artifacts, rebuilding historical objects). Have the mission model building instructions ready (printed or on a tablet) 3 and the Challenge mat unrolled on a table or floor. Gather the SPIKE Prime kit and expansion set 4, plus any spare parts if available (being a returning team, they may have last year’s robot as reference). Also prepare a brief Core Values overview to remind the team of FIRST’s values and the concept of Gracious Professionalism® 5. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Challenge Exploration: Watch the season intro video and discuss the archaeology theme – What kinds of “hidden treasures or stories” might FLL be focusing on? Kids should get excited about digging into the past as described by FIRST 6. Have them flip through the Engineering Notebooks (or any provided season handbook for team members) to see theme background and “Project Sparks” (inspiration prompts) 7. 
Field Setup: The team builds the mission models from the Challenge Set. Divide the model kits among team members to build simultaneously (assign 2–3 kids per model if necessary). As they build, encourage them to identify each mission by name/goal – e.g. “Angler Artifacts”, “Statue Rebuild”, “Silo”, etc., and roughly what the robot is expected to do for each. By session end, aim to have most mission models built and attached to the mat in the proper locations 8. Kids should also inspect how each model works (what moves, what triggers a scoring action) using the rulebook descriptions 9. This hands-on setup naturally leads to questions about mission rules, which is a great opportunity to discuss them. 
Core Values Icebreaker: Do a quick team icebreaker emphasizing teamwork (one of the Core Values). For example, a “one-word story” circle where each team member contributes one word to collectively tell a fun story about an archaeological dig – demonstrating collaboration and inclusion. Conclude by having each kid share something they’re excited to “discover” this season, tying back to the Core Value of Discovery. By the end of Session 1, the team should feel united and informed about the season’s scope. 
Session 2: Rules, Strategy Brainstorm & Chassis Build 
Coach’s Plan: Before this session, review any Game Update/Clarifications (since kickoff) in case FIRST has answered questions about missions 10. Plan to recap key Robot Game rules (e.g. scoring, penalties, updates) and facilitate an initial strategy discussion. Prepare a simple SPIKE Prime base robot design to build – this could be a basic drive base from SPIKE’s app or a proven design like the “Coop Bot” or similar (which is a modular Spike Prime base requiring core + expansion set) 11. If the team’s previous robot is available, decide if you’ll reuse it or improve it; otherwise, building a fresh chassis is a great exercise. Also prepare a chart paper or whiteboard for mission brainstorming (listing all missions and possible approaches). 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Robot Game Rule Review: The team quickly reviews Robot Game basics: point values, how missions are scored, and any special rules (e.g., use of precision tokens for penalties). Quiz the kids with a few scenarios (“What happens if the robot touches a model outside Base?”) to ensure understanding. Encourage experienced members to share examples from last season, reinforcing learning for any new teammates. 
Mission Strategy Blitz: Now that the field is built, the team does a “mission brainstorm”. Walk around the field and list all 13 missions on the board. For each mission, ask kids to think of possible ways to solve it or if it seems easy vs. hard. Don’t deep-dive into solutions yet; just mark missions that look high priority (for example, ones worth big points or sitting near Base). The goal is to develop a rough mission gameplan: identify a few “low-hanging fruit” missions that are easy and high-yield, versus complex ones that need more thought. This helps inform what attachments the robot might need (pusher, claw, lift, etc.). 
Build Basic Chassis: The team starts assembling their robot base. If reusing last year’s robot, spend time inspecting it: what worked well, what could be improved (e.g., stability, motor placement)? If building new, use a known design or instructions. An example is the “Coop Bot” chassis, a sturdy SPIKE Prime base designed for FLL missions 12. It features two drive motors, a castor or ball for balance, mounting points for attachments, and optionally two color sensors in front (helpful for line following) 13 14. Aim to have the base chassis mostly built by the end of the session – i.e., drivetrain is assembled and robot can roll. Save advanced components (sensors, attachment mechanisms) for later sessions if time is short. 
Core Values Focus: As the robot comes together, highlight Inclusion and Teamwork – everyone should contribute, whether by building, fetching parts, or reading instructions. The outcome of Session 2 is a partially built robot chassis and an initial mission strategy outline. The team should also have a team name by now, if they didn’t already – something fun that bonds them (a returning team might refresh their name or cheer). Consider creating a team poster with the name and maybe listing each member’s personal goal for the season (fostering Innovation and Fun values). 
 
Week 2: Basic Training & Concept Development 
Focus: Now that the basics are in place, week 2 solidifies the foundation. The team finishes setting up the robot and field, learns how to program the SPIKE Prime for fundamental movements and sensor use (an accelerated “Robot Training Camp”), and narrows down an Innovation Project problem to solve. By the end of this week, the robot can drive and perhaps use a sensor, and the team has chosen a specific project topic in the archaeology theme to research in depth. Core Values and teamwork skills continue to be reinforced as the group starts tackling problems together. 
Session 3: SPIKE Prime Programming 101 & Project Ideas 
Coach’s Plan: This session is akin to a robot programming workshop. Make sure the SPIKE Prime hub is charged and the programming device (laptop/tablet) is set up with the SPIKE App. Prepare a few basic programming challenges (using block coding) to teach essential skills: e.g., moving a certain distance, turning, using the gyro or color sensor. The official materials refer to this as “Training Camp 1: Driving Around” 15 – you can mirror that by guiding the team through a simple drive-forward program and perhaps a loop or sensor block. Also identify one easy mission model on the field that the team can interact with for practice (for example, a mission where the robot just needs to push or reach something). Additionally, come with resources for the Innovation Project: the project theme details and examples. Facilitate a brainstorm to generate project ideas: since the season is archaeology-focused, the project should involve identifying a real-world problem related to exploring or preserving the past. Be ready with a few “Project Sparks” or prompts (the challenge documents often provide prompts) to inspire the kids 16 – e.g., How might we protect ancient artifacts? How could technology help archaeologists? Also prepare a method for idea selection (like dot voting) to help them converge on one idea by session’s end. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Finish Robot Build: If any parts of the base robot were unfinished, the team completes assembly (e.g., mounting sensors, securing cables). Ensure the SPIKE Prime brick connects to the programming device. Celebrate when the robot is “alive” and ready to code. 
Basic Coding Drills: The kids start programming with SPIKE Prime’s block language. As a first exercise, have them write a simple program to drive the robot forward and back a specific distance (e.g., 30 cm forward, then stop) – this covers motor movement blocks and possibly using the built-in motor rotation sensor to measure distance. Next, introduce a turn (e.g., turn 90 degrees) so they learn to coordinate motors. If the team is comfortable, introduce using the gyro sensor to turn accurately, or the color sensor to detect the black lines on the mat. For instance, challenge them to program the robot to “move until it sees a black line” on the field – a common FLL technique 17. This uses a loop or wait block with the color sensor input, and teaches them to integrate sensor feedback in code. By doing these mini-exercises, the team refreshes their coding know-how (or learns quickly by doing). Each kid or pair can take turns at the keyboard, or split into sub-teams tackling different tasks (one doing straight moves, another figuring out the turn). The outcome should be a basic driving program and possibly a demonstrated ability to stop at a line or follow a line edge for a short distance. These skills will be directly useful for missions. 
Innovation Project Brainstorm: Shift focus to the project. Recap that the Innovation Project requires identifying a problem related to the season theme and designing an innovative solution, which they will later present to judges 18. The team should throw out ideas in a brainstorming session: encourage free thinking, no idea is too silly at this stage. For “Unearthed,” ideas might range from “a device to help archaeologists dig without damaging artifacts” to “an app to bring ancient stories to life for kids.” Have one member record all ideas. Aim to generate a good list, then discuss each idea’s pros/cons briefly. By end of brainstorm, try to narrow down to 2-3 favorite project ideas that seem both interesting and feasible. (The team will research these outside of meeting time if possible, or as “homework.”) 
Core Values Check-in: After a technical coding session, take a short break for a team-building exercise that reinforces communication. For example, have the kids pair up to guide each other through a simple obstacle course blindfolded (or with eyes closed) using only verbal instructions – metaphoric for how precise the robot programming needs to be, and highlighting trust and communication. Debrief how this relates to Teamwork and Communication (a life skill FLL fosters 19). The outcome of Session 3 is a driving robot with initial programs and a focused list of project concepts to investigate. 
Session 4: Sensors & Strategy; Pick Project Problem 
Coach’s Plan: This session wraps up Phase 1 by solidifying sensor programming skills and making strategic decisions. Plan a continuation of the “Training Camp” with a focus on using sensors and attachments – e.g., “Training Camp 3: Reacting to Lines” and object manipulation, as per FIRST’s guide 20. Set up a scenario to use the color sensor or ultrasonic (distance) sensor if available: perhaps have the robot follow a line for a short path or stop at a certain color marking (some mats have colored areas) 21. Also, if the robot chassis is ready, you can attach a simple arm or plow attachment to test moving a mission model. Meanwhile, be ready to guide the team in choosing one Innovation Project problem out of the brainstormed ideas – likely the one that resonates most or has the most potential. Gather some quick facts or visuals for those top ideas to help inform their choice (e.g., if one idea was protecting cave paintings, have a quick stat about a challenge in archaeology they can solve). Finally, prepare to introduce the concept of project research – how to systematically learn more about their chosen problem. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Advanced Robot Practice: The team extends their programming skills. If they started line following or sensor work in Session 3, now push it further. For example, create a small test on the field: Can you program the robot to drive forward until it reaches the first black line on the mat, then make a left turn precisely 90°? They’ll need to combine movement blocks with sensor conditionals (using the color sensor to detect the line) and maybe utilize the gyro for an accurate turn. This mimics real mission requirements where alignment is crucial. Another task: use the medium motor (if SPIKE Prime has one attached) to make a simple attachment movement, such as lowering an arm. For instance, if there’s a mission to lift or push something (like “Tip the Scales” mission), have them prototype how an attachment might work – e.g., program the arm motor to move 45° downward to push a lever. This introduces the idea of modular attachments that can be added or removed for different missions (designing the robot in modular way is key for efficiency 22). By practicing a basic attachment motion, the kids learn how to control multiple motors and time actions. They should also calibrate sensors if needed (like ensure the color sensor can reliably distinguish the mat’s black lines from other colors). At this stage, the robot might complete a simple combined task like “drive forward, follow a line, then stop in front of Mission X.” This is a big milestone – it means the team can now start tackling actual missions next phase with some confidence. 
Select Project Problem: Revisit the short-listed project ideas from last session. Ask the team: which idea are they most excited about? Which seems like a problem they could realistically research and innovate on in the given time? Use a democratic method (like each kid ranks the ideas) or consensus to pick ONE clear project problem to pursue. Once decided, define it explicitly. For example: “Our project problem: Archaeologists often damage artifacts when excavating – we will find a solution to excavate carefully.” It could be any well-scoped issue in the archaeology theme. This decision is important as it focuses their research moving forward. Encourage the team by showing enthusiasm for their choice and perhaps brainstorming a team slogan or hashtag around it (fun element to boost identity and Fun Core Value). 
Plan Project Research: Now that a problem is chosen, have the team list what they need to learn to solve it. For instance, “What techniques/tools do archaeologists use today? What are the limitations? Has anyone tried to solve this before?” Assign research tasks that kids can do before next week (each team member or pair takes a question to investigate via internet or library). Also discuss who could be a good expert to talk to (e.g., a local archaeologist, a museum curator, a professor). Identifying an expert now is great, so you can schedule a visit or call by mid-season. The kids should also start thinking of potential solutions in the back of their minds, but emphasize first understanding the problem deeply (discovery and impact first, innovation later 23). 
Core Values & Teamwork: As Phase 1 concludes, reflect on the team’s progress. Have a brief roundtable: “What was one thing another teammate did that helped you this week?”. This reflection encourages gratitude and Gracious Professionalism – recognizing each other’s contributions positively 24. For fun, you might introduce a Core Values poster in the room where the team can add sticky notes each week noting examples of values in action (building a visual record of their teamwork). The outcome of Session 4 is a confident team ready to dive into full mission and project work, with their robot driving reliably and their project problem defined and primed for research. 
 
Phase 2: Intensive Development & Refinement (Weeks 3–12) 
Phase 2 spans the remaining 10 weeks and is where the meat of the work happens. In this phase, the team will iteratively build and program solutions for all 13 robot missions and develop their Innovation Project from concept to final presentation. The approach is incremental: each week the team will tackle a subset of missions, design or refine attachments, and add code, while simultaneously conducting project research or developing their solution and prototype. Core Values practices continue, and competition preparation elements (judging practice, robot run-throughs, etc.) ramp up as the tournament approaches (especially in the final weeks). The timeline below outlines major milestones the team should hit: 
 
Throughout Phase 2, encourage iterative improvement: design-test-improve cycles are fundamental. Remind the kids that it's normal if missions don't work on first try – identify why and improve (this is real engineering!). Keep tying activities back to Core Values: celebrate innovation when a clever solution emerges, emphasize inclusion by ensuring all team members have a role in both robot and project work, and keep the atmosphere fun even as the workload increases. 
Weeks 3–4: Attacking Missions & Research Deep Dive 
Focus: Now in “full swing,” the team concentrates on Robot Game mission development and serious research for the project. In these two weeks, aim to get a handful of missions (perhaps 3–5) reliably solved by the robot and to solidify the project’s direction by researching existing solutions and formulating an innovative idea. It’s also time to start thinking about robust attachment design – modular tools that can be swapped on the robot for different tasks. By end of Week 4, the base robot should be essentially complete (chassis tuned, sensors working, maybe a gyro for accuracy) and several mission programs should be functioning on the field. The team should also decide on a specific project solution concept to develop, based on their research findings. 
Session 5: First Mission Mode & Research Planning 
Coach’s Plan: Identify one of the simpler missions as the team’s first to fully solve – ideally a mission near the home base with minimal complex action (for example, a mission where the robot just needs to push an object into a scoring area or deliver something). Common strategy is to tackle easy missions first to build confidence. Prepare the detailed Mission description and rules for that mission (from the rulebook) so the team understands exactly what constitutes success and any constraints 25. Also, prepare materials for the Innovation Project research: perhaps printouts of articles or examples related to their chosen problem, and possibly a list of existing solutions or attempts (what do people do today about that problem?). If you haven’t yet, now is a good time to introduce the official Project Rubric (so the team knows what judges look for: problem identification, innovative solution, research, etc.) and make a research plan. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Solve First Mission: The team focuses on programming and testing a complete mission. For instance, if the first mission is “Angler Artifacts” (hypothetical example: robot needs to grab a fish artifact and bring it back), the kids design an attachment or mechanism to accomplish it – maybe a claw or a scoop. They likely prototype something using the SPIKE Prime kit pieces: e.g., a simple lever arm that snaps onto the front of the robot to hook the artifact. They then write a program: drive to the artifact’s location (perhaps following a line or using a consistent angle turn from base), lower the arm to capture it, then return to base. This will require multiple iterations: measure distances on the mat, tune motor power for consistency, test if the attachment reliably grabs the object. It’s normal that the first few tries fail or something misaligns. Encourage the team to debug systematically: if the robot misses the object, is it an aiming issue (adjust turn angle) or an attachment issue (doesn’t hook properly)? They should refine the attachment (maybe add a guide or rubber piece for grip) and adjust the code. By session end, Mission 1 should be completed successfully at least once. They should document this success (e.g., write in their engineering notebook what solution they built and how many points it earns). This victory sets the stage for tackling harder missions. 
Additional Attachment Brainstorm: Solving the first mission will spark ideas for others. As time permits, have the team sketch or discuss what attachments/tools the robot might need for other missions (e.g., a lifting arm for “Statue Rebuild” or a plow for clearing debris). Encourage modular design – perhaps the attachment base can stay consistent and just different end-effectors are swapped 26. No need to build them all now, but having a plan (maybe a list of missions and a proposed attachment type for each) is useful. 
Project Research Plan: Transition to project work. The team should start researching the current state of their problem. If their problem was “damaging artifacts during excavation,” for example, what methods do archaeologists currently use and what are the shortcomings? Each member (or pair) can share any findings from their “homework” or do a quick supervised internet search during the meeting. Gather the facts: what causes the problem, who is affected, existing solutions or technologies related to it, etc. Often teams will discover that professionals have some tools but they might be expensive or not fully effective. This research phase aligns with the Identify and Research steps in the project requirements 27. Capture notes on a board or Google Doc that the team can refer to later. By the end of Session 5, the team should have a clearer picture of the problem and maybe some insight into what gaps or opportunities exist for their innovative solution. Decide on next steps: maybe identify an expert to contact or specific aspects to research deeper. Assign any follow-up research tasks for the kids to do before the next session. 
Core Values – Respect & Impact: During this flurry of technical work, note moments of cooperation: e.g., two kids who combined their attachment ideas to make a better design, or someone who stepped aside to let another try a coding idea. Praise these in the context of Impact (one of the core values) – their collaborative behavior is impacting the team’s success positively 28. You might also do a quick “rose and thorn” where each team member says one thing that went well (rose) and one challenge (thorn) in solving the mission. This encourages open communication and a continuous improvement mindset (a growth mindset fosters Innovation and Excellence). 
Session 6: Multiple Missions & Ideation of Solution 
Coach’s Plan: In this session, the team will try to extend their robot’s capabilities to more missions, and ideally by now you want to introduce the idea of a project solution. Prepare to guide them through a mission strategy discussion: which missions to attempt next, possibly how to combine tasks in one run. Also plan a mini-lesson on structured programming (maybe introduce the concept of pseudocode or flowcharting before coding a complex sequence) – this corresponds to the official “Pseudocode and Mission Strategy” session 29. For the project, gather any creative thinking tools you might use (like a mind map or design thinking exercise) to help the team brainstorm solutions now that they have researched the problem. Make sure any new parts for attachments are sorted and available – as the robot might start getting more add-ons. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Concurrent Mission Work: Divide and conquer for efficiency. The team can split into sub-teams to tackle two different missions in parallel (especially if they have more than 4 members, this works well). For example, one sub-team works on programming Mission 2 while another works on Mission 3. They can swap halfway so everyone gets experience on each. Choose missions that are independent (on different sides of the field, for instance) so one robot configuration can attempt one, and perhaps a different attachment is needed for the other. If Mission 2 (say, “Tip the Scales”) needs a ramp or specific device, those kids design that attachment and code the actions for it, while Mission 3 (say, “Map Reveal”) might just require pushing a lever, so a simpler attachment is used by the other group. This parallel approach can significantly accelerate progress but requires good communication. The coach should ensure the sub-teams share what they learn with each other – maybe at mid-session, have a quick sync where each group shows their partially working mission. By the end, aim to have at least two more missions solved (or very close to solved). It’s okay if they’re rough or not 100% consistent yet, as refinement will come later. The most important outcome is that the robot now has demonstrated solutions for ~3 missions in total, and the team is practicing how to systematically approach new challenges using the skills they’ve learned. 
Mission Strategy Refinement: With a few missions under their belt, prompt the team to think about overall strategy for the Robot Game. Which missions can be grouped in one trip? How many trips (robot returns to base) might they need in a round to cover everything? For instance, maybe Missions 1, 2, 5 are all on the east side of the mat, so they could be one “trip” if designed well. Start listing mission groupings or pairs that could be done together to save time. This strategic thinking will guide their attachment design – maybe they can create a single attachment that can handle two missions in one go, which is ideal. 
Innovation Project – Define Solution Idea: Now pivot to the project’s solution. The team has research insight by now, so ask: “Given what we learned, what could we create or propose to solve this problem?”. This is a pure creative ideation moment – encourage wild ideas, drawing from science or imagination. Use a whiteboard to sketch if helpful. For example, if the problem is damaging artifacts, possible solutions could be “a smart digging machine with sensors that detect artifacts before hitting them”, or “a special gel that hardens soil around artifacts to protect them while digging”, just anything. Let the kids build on each other’s suggestions (yes-and thinking). Eventually, try to converge on one innovative solution concept the team finds promising. It should be something they can explain and maybe prototype a part of. Once chosen, articulate it clearly: e.g., “Our solution: a Smart Trowel tool that beeps when it senses an artifact underground”. Check that it’s indeed innovative (not just something that exists identically) and that it addresses the problem they identified. This now becomes the focus of their project work. 
Plan Next Steps for Project: With a solution in mind, create a to-do list: What needs to be done to flesh out this solution? Perhaps building a prototype or model, coding a demo if it involves software, or preparing a presentation format. Also, this is a good time to identify an expert to consult about the solution idea – for example, reach out to that archaeologist or a professor and ask if the team can share their idea and get feedback in a coming session. If possible, schedule this expert interaction for a few weeks out (Week 6 or 7) so the kids have some concept to show by then. Assign roles or tasks: some kids can work on a physical prototype (e.g., assembling LEGO or craft materials to simulate the tool), others can work on a poster or slides that explain the idea, others draft questions for the expert. 
Core Values – Innovation & Persistence: A lot is happening! Take a moment to recognize the Innovation Core Value in action: the team has creatively combined their knowledge to propose a unique solution. Also, likely not everything went smoothly in the mission coding – maybe a new bug arose. Highlight how the team persisted and solved it, embodying “We use creativity and persistence to solve problems”, directly from FIRST’s values 30. End session with a fun note – perhaps a quick team cheer or a high-five chain to celebrate reaching the quarter-way mark of the season. 
Weeks 5–6: Mid-Season Development & “Feedback” 
Focus: By the middle of the timeline, the robot should be making significant progress and the project enters development of the solution. During weeks 5–6, the team works on the remaining robot missions, aiming to have at least a basic solution or approach for all missions by the end of week 6. It’s ambitious, but even having rough code/attachments for each mission means the rest of the season can be spent on improvement. This is also a great time to get external feedback: maybe arrange a session with a subject matter expert for the project or a friendly scrimmage with another team to test robot ideas. By the end of week 6, the team can do a brief assessment of where they stand: which missions are done, which need more work, and how their project solution is shaping up. This checkpoint allows re-scoping if needed (e.g., drop a very hard mission if time won't allow, or refine project scope). 
Session 7: Advanced Attachments & Remaining Missions 
Coach’s Plan: As the robot approaches tackling all missions, some of the more complex tasks are likely left for now. Pick a challenging mission and prepare to help the team break it down. Perhaps one mission requires a precise mechanism (like lifting an object onto a high platform or assembling pieces – e.g., the “Statue Rebuild” mission likely requires carefully placing parts together). Ensure the team has the expansion set parts ready – sometimes additional gears or beams are needed for these advanced attachments. If possible, show them examples of mechanisms (without giving a full design): for instance, demonstrate a simple gear lift or a claw mechanism, to inspire their design. Also encourage them to reuse and modify attachments they’ve already made (e.g., can the claw from Mission 1 be tweaked to also do Mission 7?). For programming, introduce any advanced concepts needed, like using My Blocks (custom functions) for repeated actions to simplify their code structure. Meanwhile, plan for a project check-in: by now, the team should perhaps start creating something tangible for the project (a prototype or visual aid). If the expert meeting is scheduled soon, make sure the kids have a list of questions or a short explanation of their idea prepared. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Complete Mission Portfolio: The team continues work on robot missions such that all missions have at least been attempted. They focus on those not done yet. For each remaining mission, apply the same cycle: design or pick an attachment, code a solution, test and iterate. By now, the robot might have a suite of attachments: e.g., a claw, a plow, a hook, a hopper, etc. A good practice is to create a mission-attachment chart – list each mission and which attachment (or combination) the robot will use for it. This helps ensure all missions are covered and reveals if one attachment can serve multiple missions. During this session, the team likely tackles one or two of the harder missions. For example, if “Statue Rebuild” requires stacking pieces, they might build a fork-like attachment to carry pieces and line up carefully. This could involve programming slower movements or using sensor alignment (like approaching until a touch sensor is triggered by hitting a wall, to ensure consistent positioning). They might not get it perfect yet, but even achieving partial success (such as placing one piece correctly) is progress. It’s okay if one or two missions still seem out of reach – make a note of these and consider if they might be skipped or need a creative approach later. By session end, ideally 10+ missions have some solution in progress and a few are fully done. The team’s confidence in robot design should be high now, but also they’ll notice the robot’s limitations (maybe battery is draining faster, or weight distribution is affecting turns). Encourage them to list any robot tweaks or improvements they wish to do (e.g., “make turns more reliable – maybe use gyro sensor” or “strengthen the arm so it doesn’t wobble”). These will be addressed in iteration later. 
Robot Design Discussion: At this point, pause to deliberately discuss Robot Design with the team (this is a foreshadowing of the Robot Design judging they'll face). Ask them questions like judges might: “Why did you choose this chassis design?”, “How do your attachments work?”, “How did you program the robot to align consistently?”. This gets them thinking about their engineering process and can reveal any weak spots that need addressing (for instance, if they realize they rely on luck for alignment, it may prompt employing sensors or guides). Document this discussion in their notes – it will help when writing the executive summary or talking to judges later. 
Project Prototype Work: Shift to the project and focus on developing the solution prototype. Depending on the idea, this could mean physically building something (perhaps out of LEGO, cardboard, or other craft materials) or designing a digital prototype (drawings, simulations). For a device like the “Smart Trowel,” maybe the team can repurpose an old sensor and a buzzer to simulate how it detects objects (this could be just conceptual if not buildable). The kids should at least make a mock-up that they can show. If they plan a presentation skit or demo, they could start scripting or storyboarding how to present their solution in an engaging way. They should also practice explaining their solution: what it is, how it works, and why it’s innovative. This session is a good time to prepare for meeting an expert (if one is scheduled for Session 8 or 9). Have the team role-play describing the problem and solution to someone unfamiliar, and writing down key questions they want to ask the expert (e.g., “Would a tool like this actually be useful in real digs? How could we improve it?”). 
Core Values – Inclusion & Team Roles: By now, team members may have gravitated to certain roles (one loves coding, another always builds attachments, another leads the project research). Take a moment to acknowledge everyone’s contributions and ensure inclusion: every member should try a bit of everything over the season, so they all learn. Perhaps rotate roles next session (e.g., someone new drives the robot for testing, or a builder gets to present the project idea). Remind them that everyone should understand the whole project and robot, even if they specialize – judges may ask anyone on the team about any part. This nurtures the value of Inclusion and also prepares them for competition. A quick exercise: have each student explain one part of the project or one mission to the rest, as if explaining to a judge. This builds confidence and shared understanding. 
Session 8: Testing, Feedback & Midpoint Review 
Coach’s Plan: This session marks roughly the halfway point of the 12-week plan. It’s a perfect time to do a “mid-season retrospective”. Plan to run an informal mock Robot Game round and perhaps invite a friendly volunteer or another coach to observe and provide feedback (or even another team for a mini scrimmage, if possible). Have the field set up fully and all attachments ready for a run-through of all missions the team can do so far. Also, if you arranged an expert consultation, this session could be when the expert joins to hear the project idea (alternatively, do it in Session 9). Prepare the team to present their project pitch and robot demo to this guest. If no live expert is available yet, you as a coach can simulate by stepping into a “judge” role temporarily. Gather any scoring sheets or rubrics to objectively score how things are going (you can use an official Robot Game scoresheet to tally their points so far, and the project rubric to rate their solution progress). 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Robot Game Mock Round: Set a timer for 2.5 minutes and have the team run their robot like it’s an actual match 31. They’ll need to pick which missions to attempt in that time and in what order. This is likely the first time they string multiple missions in one go without debugging in between. Expect chaos! The robot might succeed on some missions and fail on others, or attachments might be fumbled when swapping. That’s okay – this is exactly why practice is needed. After the buzzer, have the kids calculate their score using the official scoring rules (how many missions did they complete successfully, etc.). This gives a baseline. Then discuss as a team: What went wrong? Did they spend too long on one mission? Did something break? This will highlight where to focus improvements. Perhaps they realize an attachment takes too long to put on, so maybe that attachment can be redesigned to be quicker to install, or combined with another one. Or they realize the robot drifted off course – maybe they need to use more sensor guidance or slow down certain moves. This experiential learning is invaluable. It also builds their stamina for the real competition pressure. 
Robot Adjustments: After the mock round, allow time for the team to fix one or two critical issues that surfaced. For example, if mission X never worked, they might quickly adjust the code or mechanism and test it in isolation. They should not try to solve everything now – just the big pain points. Emphasize iterative improvement: “Okay, our first full run was 4 missions completed for 120 points in 2:30. Let’s aim to raise that next time.” It’s also a chance to see if any mission is consistently not working – the team might decide to put that one aside and focus on others (that’s a strategic call: sometimes skipping a problematic mission to focus on others yields a higher score overall). 
Project Feedback (Expert or Mentor): If an expert or mentor is present, the team presents their project: they explain the problem they chose and their proposed solution. Encourage the kids to do this with minimal help, as if they’re in the Project judging session. The expert/coach should ask them questions and give constructive feedback. For instance, the expert might say “Have you considered how archaeologists would carry that tool in the field?” or “This reminds me of X technology; how is yours different?” Such feedback can spark improvements. The kids should note any suggestions – perhaps it reveals they need to adjust their solution or do a bit more research on a particular aspect. If no external person is available, do a round-robin: have half the team pretend to be judges and ask questions, then switch. This not only helps improve the project but practices their presentation and Q\&A skills. 
Core Values – Coopertition® and Sharing: If you did invite another team or a guest, point out how sharing and cooperating with others can help everyone – this is Coopertition® in FLL terms (friendly cooperation in competition) 32. Compliment the team on how they handled feedback: listening respectfully and being willing to improve shows professionalism. To lighten up after the serious review, perhaps do a quick fun activity like each member shares the funniest or most surprising thing that happened so far in the season. This reinforces that, while they are working hard toward competition, they’re also having fun together – which is an FLL Core Value in itself. 
By the end of Week 6, the team should feel proud of what they’ve accomplished: a majority of missions have solutions, the project has a clear direction with an initial prototype and external input, and they have a sense of what needs work in the second half of the season. This is a crucial turning point where the focus shifts from creating to refining. 
Weeks 7–8: Iteration and Refinement 
Focus: With all missions attempted and a project solution in the works, weeks 7–8 are about improving and optimizing. The robot’s mission solutions should be iterated for greater reliability and maybe combined more efficiently. The project prototype or presentation should be refined based on any feedback (perhaps building a more polished prototype or running a demo). This is also the period to ensure all team members can explain both the robot and project clearly – so integrating “teaching moments” where kids practice describing their code or design is key. Aiming for consistency in robot runs is important now: the team will work on fine-tuning movements, possibly utilizing sensors and guide-jigs on the field to reduce variability. Core Values exercises can focus on problem-solving under pressure to simulate what might happen if things go wrong in competition. By end of Week 8, the goal is an essentially competition-ready robot and a fully developed project solution, leaving the final weeks for full-scale practice and polishing. 
Session 9: Robot Optimization & Solution Improvements 
Coach’s Plan: Now that all mission solutions exist in some form, focus this session on optimization. Identify the weakest three missions or the ones that fail most often and tackle those. Prepare to guide the team through a systematic debugging or redesign if needed. For instance, if a mission is failing 50% of the time, have them run it multiple times to gather data on what goes wrong – is it always veering left? Always just short of an object? Suggest possibly adding a reading of the gyro or sensor mid-run to self-correct (introduce the idea of a checkpoint in code, like using a line alignment halfway). If not done yet, introduce creating My Blocks (custom subroutines) for repeated tasks (like a consistent “line square-up” routine) to simplify their codebase and avoid copy-pasting code. Also emphasize the importance of a tidy code – maybe have them comment their programs or organize them in the app. For the project, plan to have the team implement any good suggestions from the feedback session. If the expert recommended a change or addition, ensure the kids consider it and possibly integrate it. For example, maybe they suggested adding a sensor to the Smart Trowel prototype – can the team simulate that with a color sensor or an LED on their prototype? Plan to also discuss the presentation format clearly now: will they do a skit, or a straight talk, or play roles (e.g., archaeologists demonstrating the tool)? Begin outlining the presentation content (they will finalize and practice it in coming sessions). 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Refine Mission Solutions: The team goes into troubleshooting mode for the robot. They likely focus on a few missions that are not meeting expectations. For each such mission, they apply iterative improvement: adjust the mechanical design or adjust the program logic. For example, they realize the robot consistently misses a target because wheel skid causes inaccuracy – so they decide to slow down the approach or use a different reference (like aligning along a wall). Or they add a second attempt in code: if the first attempt to grab an object fails (maybe detected via a sensor or simply a timing second chance), the robot backs up and tries again. These are advanced tactics that experienced teams use to make missions more robust. The kids might also optimize for speed now: if a mission is reliable but slow, can they shave off a few seconds? For instance, combining two missions in one trip might save the time of a return to base, so they practice doing that back-to-back. This might involve merging two programs and figuring out where to transition (like after finishing Mission A, reposition the robot for Mission B without returning home). Because the code is getting complex, ensure they keep backups of working versions in case an optimization breaks something. By the end of this session, the robot should be performing more consistently, with improvements made to problematic missions and possibly a quicker overall execution. They might achieve a new high score in practice, which is motivating. 
Attachment Inventory & Prep: A small but important task: have the team organize all their attachments and label them (if not already). This is both practical (so they can find and swap them quickly during matches) and part of robot design documentation – judges often appreciate seeing a clear system of attachments. The team could even create a quick reference sheet with pictures of each attachment and what missions it’s for. Creating this inventory reinforces their understanding of the entire robot system. 
Project Solution Iteration: The kids refine their innovation project. Based on any feedback, they might tweak the solution. Suppose the expert said the tool should be lighter – they can’t physically change weight in a prototype, but they might incorporate that requirement into their explanation (acknowledging trade-offs and future improvements is actually a great thing to mention to judges). They continue building out the prototype if it’s not complete or make it more presentation-ready (painting it, making sure it’s sturdy enough to handle). If they plan a digital element (like a slideshow or a video snippet to show), they gather those assets. Ensure they have evidence of their research to show judges: maybe a brief summary of what they learned from real-world experts or literature, since the project rubric values research depth and sharing with the community 33. If not already done, they could actually do a quick share activity – for example, present their idea to another class at school or a group of parents and note the feedback. This counts as “sharing their solution,” which is part of the project requirements and Core Values (Impact and Inclusion). 
Outline Presentation: It’s time to draft the structure of their 5-minute project presentation. Common formats include a skit (e.g., acting out a story that introduces the problem and solution) or a more formal briefing. Let the team decide what fits their style – returning teams often enjoy doing creative skits to stand out. Outline should include: an introduction (who they are, what the theme is), the problem description, how they researched it, their solution (with demo or prototype showcase), and a conclusion or call to action. They should also mention how they shared or plan to implement the solution. Get this outline on paper (or computer). If time permits, allocate who will talk for each part or who plays which role in a skit. 
Core Values – Teamwork under pressure: At this stage, tensions can rise when debugging tough missions or deciding presentation roles. Watch for any conflicts and use them as teachable moments. For instance, if two kids disagree on a robot approach, pause and have each articulate their reasoning, then perhaps test both ideas experimentally. Show that respectful listening and compromise are key (Core Value of Teamwork and Inclusion). You might invoke Gracious Professionalism explicitly: how would they handle such disagreements gracefully? Perhaps introduce a simple rule: when debating ideas, use “I like, I wish” format (e.g., “I like John’s idea because X, I wish we could also do Y from Jane’s idea”). This encourages finding merit in all suggestions and combining them when possible. By end of Session 9, the team should feel that both robot and project are on track, with just final polishing needed. 
Session 10: Finalizing Robot & Drafting Presentation 
Coach’s Plan: This session likely sees the robot in a near-final state. Plan to do a full test of all missions individually to verify nothing broke during recent optimizations. Essentially a checklist: mission 1 OK, mission 2 OK, ... mission 13 OK. For any still iffy missions, decide if it’s worth additional tweaking or if time suggests leaving it as is (if it’s a low point mission and taking too long to fix, maybe better to allocate time to perfecting higher-value missions). Prepare to help the team make these priority decisions using the scoring values. Also, encourage the team to start thinking about Robot Design executive summary or judging artifacts if your region requires it (some tournaments have teams fill a sheet about their robot). A simple bullet list of their robot’s key features (e.g., “two-motor differential drive, gyro for turns, color sensor for line following, 4 interchangeable attachments”) can be drafted. For the project presentation, now it’s drafting/writing time. Bring large chart paper or a laptop to write the script. If it’s a skit, help them frame it into a coherent story; if it’s a demo format, ensure they cover all rubric points (problem, solution, research, sharing, core values reflection if any). Plan to have a first full draft of the presentation by the end of this session, so it can be practiced in weeks 11–12. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Robot Polishing: The team conducts a thorough test of each mission solution, one by one. They mark any that fail and quickly try to address small fixes. At this point, changes should be minor – e.g., adjusting a speed or adding a little delay, rather than redesigning an entire attachment. They also examine the robot hardware for wear and tear: tighten any loose beams or screws, check wheels for friction issues, maybe replace batteries or ensure the rechargeable hub is holding enough charge (freshly charge it for each practice from now on to mimic competition conditions). The kids should feel that they have a reliable robot – maybe not perfect, but one they know how to operate and that can accomplish their chosen missions consistently. If a mission is still not working at all and it’s low points, consider officially dropping it to avoid wasting time – this is a strategic decision sometimes needed. They should then adjust their match gameplan accordingly (maybe they’ll ignore mission 7 and focus on others). 
Document Robot Strategy: Have the team write or record a short summary of their robot strategy and design. This is effectively preparation for the Robot Design judging. Points to include: what makes their robot special or effective? (e.g., “Our robot is very modular; we can change attachments quickly and we programmed it to realign on lines for consistency 34.”) Also mention any innovative techniques they used (like a unique attachment or a clever bit of code). This summary can serve as notes for when they talk to judges, or if required they can put it on a poster or handout. The act of summarizing also consolidates their understanding. 
Complete Project Presentation Script: The team finalizes the content of their project presentation. They divide speaking parts and write down each person’s lines or cues. For a skit, detail the scenes and who says what, including a narration of the problem and demo of the solution. Ensure the important facts from their research are included (to show they’ve done their homework) and that they clearly state how their solution is innovative. Since time is limited to 5 minutes, they should keep it concise and practice timing sections as they create them. They might realize they have too much content and need to cut or simplify some explanations – guide them to focus on the most important elements (e.g., we don’t need every stat from research, just enough to show the problem’s significance). By now, each team member should have a meaningful role in the presentation. Also include at least a brief mention of how they incorporated Core Values or worked as a team, as judges often appreciate that in the project presentation too (“Throughout our project, we worked together and even consulted an archaeologist – showing our discovery and inclusion values”). 
Prototype Final Touches: If the project solution prototype needs any final touches (paint, glue, last-minute fixes), they should finish that now so it’s ready for the practice presentations next week. If the solution cannot be physically demonstrated, perhaps prepare a short video or poster to show how it would work (some teams make a video of a concept if they can’t build it for real – this can be played or just described). 
Core Values – Preparing for Judging: Discuss how Core Values are often evaluated continuously (judges watch how the team interacts) and sometimes in a dedicated session or with a surprise teamwork challenge. Encourage them to always uphold respect and enthusiasm, even during stressful moments. Perhaps do a mock Core Values challenge: e.g., give the team a task like “build the tallest tower you can with these LEGO pieces in 5 minutes as a team” and see how they work together. Afterwards, discuss what they did well (did they include everyone? communicate?) and what they could improve (maybe someone was too bossy or someone too quiet). This prepares them for any on-the-spot teamwork exercises and reinforces their readiness to demonstrate Gracious Professionalism at the event. 
By the end of Session 10, the team is essentially event-ready on paper: robot solutions done, project solution done, presentation scripted, and core values mindset solidified. The next two weeks will be about practice, practice, practice – just like a sports team scrimmaging before the big game, they will rehearse everything to iron out any remaining wrinkles. 
Weeks 9–10: Practice and Integration 
Focus: With all content developed, these weeks are dedicated to practice and integration – bringing everything together in simulated environments to build confidence and identify any last areas for improvement. The team will practice their project presentation repeatedly, as well as run full robot game matches under timed conditions to work on flow and timing. They will also practice the Robot Design explanation for judges, ensuring each member can speak to some part of the robot/program. Essentially, weeks 9–10 turn the team into polished performers and troubleshooters: ready to handle the pressure of competition. Core Values emphasis is on celebrating progress and staying positive, reinforcing that no matter what happens at the tournament, they’ve achieved a lot as a team. By the end of week 10, the team should be performing at a competition-ready level in all areas. 
Session 11: Full Runs and Presentation Practice 
Coach’s Plan: This session should mimic an actual tournament schedule as much as possible. Plan to have the team do a complete Project Presentation run-through (with timing and any visual aids set up), followed by a Robot Design Q\&A practice, and a Core Values discussion like judges might have, and later a full Robot Game match practice. If possible, arrange for some observers (other teachers, parents, or another team’s coach) to act as judges in a mock judging session. Provide them with the official rubrics for Project, Robot Design, and Core Values so they can evaluate and then give the team feedback. Make sure the room is set up appropriately for presenting (projector or boards for them if needed). And set up the robot field as per competition standards (make sure mission models are reset correctly each time). Essentially, this is a dress rehearsal for the competition. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Mock Judging – Project Presentation: The team delivers their 5-minute project presentation in full, treating whomever is watching as judges. They should use all props, prototypes, and have any slides or posters ready. Emphasize presentation skills: speaking clearly, making eye contact, being enthusiastic. If it’s a skit, they should get into character and have fun with it (judges love to see the team’s personality). After the presentation, have the mock judges (or coach) ask them typical follow-up questions for a few minutes: e.g., “How did you come up with this solution?”, “How do you know this is a real problem?”, “Did you consider other solutions?”, “How did your team divide the work?”, etc. The kids should practice answering without looking at each other cluelessly – ideally each question can be taken by whoever feels confident, or a couple of them add on. This tests their deep understanding. It’s alright if some answers aren’t perfect; that identifies where they need clarity. For example, if they stumble on “how is this innovative?” they might need to articulate better what’s novel in their solution. The presentation and Q\&A practice will likely reveal a few spots to tweak (maybe they went over time, or a part of the explanation was unclear). Take note and adjust the script or responses as needed after the mock session. 
Mock Judging – Robot Design & Core Values: Next, simulate a Robot Design judging. This can be more free-form: have the team bring their robot with all attachments to a table and explain it to the “judges.” They should point out features (sensors, how attachments mount, any unique design choices) and might even run a short demo of a trick if space allows (or show code snippets). The judges might ask: “How did you program X?”, “Why did you use a gyro sensor here?”, “What was your design process?” 35. The team members who did the coding should be ready to talk about it, and everyone should know at least broadly how the robot works. This is where the documentation and talking points they prepared in Session 10 help. Also include a couple of Core Values questions like “How does your team handle conflicts?” or “What Core Value do you think your team exemplifies the most?” The kids can share real examples (like conflict resolution or helping another team with something). This Q\&A builds poise and ensures they won’t be caught off guard in the real judging rooms. 
Feedback and Improvement: After these mock judging exercises, the observers give feedback. The team should listen and maybe even take notes. Discuss as a team what could be improved – perhaps someone was too quiet, or they forgot to mention a critical part of the project, or the robot demo didn’t really show the coolest mechanism. Use this to refine. If no external judges were present, the coach can step out of the “coach” role and tell them frankly how they did in each area according to the rubrics 36 (e.g., did they cover all rubric points, did everyone participate, etc.). Plan to implement feedback in the next session practices. 
Robot Run Practice: Now pivot to the Robot Game. Have the team do another full 2.5-minute robot run, trying to execute their planned mission schedule. By now, they likely have a known routine: e.g., “Trip 1: do missions A, B, C, then come home; Trip 2: change attachments, do missions D, E; etc.” Time them and see if they can finish all planned missions within the match time. They should be getting better, but any new issues that pop up should be minor. Emphasize consistency and teamwork during the run: who is resetting attachments? Who is handling the robot between runs? This should be choreographed so they don’t waste time (usually 1-2 kids handle the robot on the field at competition, but ensure all know the plan). After the run, if there’s time, let them immediately try one more run to beat their score or to implement a quick fix from a mistake observed. Repetition will build their confidence. Perhaps challenge them: “Can you break 300 points?” (or whatever is a stretch goal slightly above their current best). Gamify it to keep it exciting. 
Core Values – Fun and Team Spirit: At this stage, the team might be a bit tired, so it’s crucial to keep Fun in the mix. Encourage them to come up with a team chant or cheer if they haven’t (something they can do before matches to pump up). Maybe design a goofy team handshake or give out silly awards (like “best save of the day” for someone who caught a falling attachment). These little things maintain morale. Also, remind them that no matter the outcome at competition, what matters is how much they learned and grew as a team. Perhaps have each member share the thing they’re most proud of accomplishing so far (you'll get a variety—from mastering a coding skill to speaking up in presentation practice). This reflection underscores the Success = learning & fun philosophy of FLL. 
By end of Session 11, the team has effectively rehearsed all elements of the competition, likely multiple times. They should feel the pressure easing as they realize they can do this, and well. 
Session 12: Final Rehearsal and Pep Talk 
Coach’s Plan: This is the last session before the competition (or culmination event). The primary objective is to do final run-throughs and resolve any last-minute issues. However, resist the temptation to overhaul anything major – it’s easy to get into a panic and try to redesign an attachment two days before competition, which usually does more harm than good. Instead, focus on ensuring everything is in order: the robot and attachments are in good condition, batteries charged, code backed up; project presentation is within time and all props are ready; each kid knows the schedule of the tournament day. Prepare a packing checklist for the tournament (robot, laptop, batteries/charger, spare parts, team display board, snacks, etc.). Also plan a fun celebratory element to conclude the final meeting – perhaps a small “certificates ceremony” where you hand out a certificate of achievement or a personalized note to each team member for their effort (there are official participation certificates 37 you could use, or make your own). The idea is to end on a high note, reinforcing their confidence and emphasizing that they already won by coming this far. 
Kids’ Activities & Outcomes: 
Polish Presentation: Do one last timed presentation run-through. By now, it should be smooth. Focus on delivery – encourage louder voices, eye contact, smiles. Maybe video record it and let them watch to self-critique, if time allows. Incorporate any tweaks from last session’s feedback (e.g., if they needed to add a line acknowledging something, ensure it’s there). Remind them to bring any physical materials for the presentation (prototype, poster, script cards if they use them) on competition day. Some teams also prepare a project report or handouts for judges – if your team did, double-check those are printed. The kids should feel proud of their project and eager to share it. Do a quick “Q\&A lightning round” for the project one more time to keep them on their toes. 
Robot Final Practice: Have the team run the robot one last time under timed conditions. Ideally, make it a no-stop, competition-realistic run (they can run it 2-3 times within this session if needed, but try to simulate the idea of one-shot performance). Don’t nitpick small errors now; the goal is to solidify their routine and get a consistent score that they are happy with. If a minor adjustment to code could significantly help consistency and they are confident about it, let them do it – but caution against any risky last-minute overhauls. This is more about the drivers/hands-on team members getting the muscle memory of swapping attachments and starting programs quickly, and others knowing their support roles (e.g., one keeps track of time or calls out which mission is next). After the final run, celebrate the achievement – perhaps it’s their best score yet, or maybe not, but either way congratulate them on getting a working robot with so many missions done. Mention how at the start of the season this was just a box of LEGO pieces and now it’s a functional engineering creation – that perspective can wow the kids about their own progress. 
Team Logistics: Go through the tournament day plan. Who will bring the robot? Do they have team shirts or coordinating outfits ready? Remind them of any key times (check-in, judging sessions, match schedules). Reiterate the importance of punctuality and staying together at the event. If any parents are helping, ensure the kids know who to look to if the coach is busy. Also, have the team tidy up their work area and pack things properly. A neat, organized kit and labeled parts can be a lifesaver if something breaks at the event – they’ll know exactly where spare parts are. 
Core Values – End with Gratitude: In a final round, ask each team member to share a favorite memory or something they learned during the season. This reflection hits on Discovery and Fun, two core values, and ends things positively. Encourage them to thank each other – maybe do a “secret teammates” where each person says one nice thing about someone else’s contribution (this could be prepared or spontaneous). Also, as a coach, share your pride in them openly. If mentors or assistant coaches helped, the team should sign a thank-you card or collectively thank them now. Instilling gratitude is part of Gracious Professionalism as well. 
Pep Talk: Finally, give a short pep talk: remind them that they are ready, that they should go into the competition confident in their work and just enjoy the experience. Win or lose, they should be courteous to other teams (maybe assign them a mission: find another team’s pit area at the event and compliment something cool they did – practicing Coopertition® 38). Maybe recall a story from last season – “Remember how last year our robot failed at X but we kept smiling and ended up with an award for teamwork? That’s the spirit to maintain.” The outcome of Session 12 is an excited, prepared team that knows exactly what to do on competition day and is ready to shine in all aspects. High-fives all around! 
 
Templates and Tools for Coaches 
To assist in executing this curriculum, here are some editable templates and resources a coach can use and adapt for their team. These include a session planning checklist, team roles assignment sheet, and a mission tracking log. Feel free to copy or adjust these for your needs: 
1. Session Preparation Checklist (Coach’s Use) – Use this before each session to ensure you have everything ready: 
[ ] Session Agenda Prepared: Key topics (robot tasks, project tasks, core values activity) defined. 
[ ] Materials Ready: Challenge documents (rules, rubrics), robot kit parts, laptop/tablet with SPIKE Prime software, mission model setup, project research printouts, etc., as needed for the day. 
[ ] Goal Set: What specific outcome should be achieved this session (e.g., “Mission 5 coded”, “project problem selected”)? 
[ ] Room & Field Setup: Table, mat, mission models in place; presentation area or whiteboard ready if needed. 
[ ] Core Values Plan: A quick game, discussion prompt, or observation focus to highlight teamwork and fun. 
[ ] Backup Plan: In case something goes awry (network issues, a key kid absent), have an alternative activity (e.g., watch an FLL tutorial video or work on engineering notebook entries). 
[ ] Post-Session Notes: After the meeting, record what was accomplished and anything to follow up on next time (useful for adjusting future plans). 
2. Team Roles & Responsibilities Chart – Ensure every team member has a primary role (or rotating roles) to foster ownership: 
Team Member 
Primary Role 
Responsibilities 
Alice 
Mechanical Designer 
Leads building of robot and attachments; ensures spare parts and tools are organized. 
Bob 
Programmer 
Writes and debugs code; keeps backup of programs; helps others learn coding. 
Charlie 
Project Lead

This tracking sheet lets the team see at a glance which missions are done, which need work, and any special notes. Update it each session. It also helps assign which mission each sub-group works on and can be shared with judges to show your iterative process. 
 
Using the Guide: This 12-week curriculum is intensive, but by following it, a returning team will cover all aspects of the FLL Challenge. Remember to remain flexible – if the team masters something quickly, move on and spend more time where they need it, or if they stumble on a concept, take a bit longer to ensure understanding. The goal is not just to “win” the competition, but to develop engineering skills, project-thinking, and teamwork in a fun and meaningful way. As a coach, celebrate progress at every step. Good luck, have fun, and go get those artifacts “unearthed”!
